<p class="drop-cap">‘STORIES of the supernatural,’ said Saunders,
‘serve at least one useful purpose:
they test a man’s intellectual capacity. Not
a very sure test, you may say; but for purposes
of rough classification it is sure enough.
Incertitude, a sense of imminent surprise, is
after all the very salt of life. Denounce the
habit of classification as bitterly as you like—and
I know well the intellectual perils that
attend it—it is none the less true that we do,
when we meet a man, like to be able to place
him, roughly, in this category or that. And
most men, by the way, submit to the process
very meekly. You subtle folk’—here Saunders
bowed to me in genial irony—‘in attributing
to the mass of mankind your own mental
complexity flatter them grossly. I have heard
you yourself discourse on the folly of the
old religious psychology which divided mankind,
arbitrarily, into sheep and goats. As
philosophy, of course, it is nonsense, and the
fathers of the church must have known that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
as well as you and I do; but as a formula
for rough-and-ready justice, it serves. If you
are pulling your weight in the boat you are a
good man; if you are not pulling your weight
you are a bad man—that is a definite and
verifiable verdict based on rational calculation.
The fun begins when having made our calculation,
and acted on it, new factors begin to
appear which knock all our arithmetic silly.
But in our dealings with men how rarely,
on the whole, that happens! You do not
agree? Well, you are permitted to disagree
so long as you believe me to be sincere in my
opinion. All modern thought, I know, is
moving away from my idea as fast as, according
to you, it is moving away from my church;
but I fancy that, in practice, the world will
continue to adhere to it. If I were to say
that all men are types, that would be not so
much a falsehood as a wanton exaggeration of
a truth. I know all that can be urged, and
justly urged, against pigeon-hole classification;
but what impresses and startles me is how
easily the greater number of one’s fellow-creatures
fit into the pigeon-holes. Unique
souls, no doubt; but the human soul is a
mystery which I don’t profess to understand
and which you profess not to believe in. It
is the ordinary workaday mentality of a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
that can be labelled with some approach to
accuracy. And the supernatural story, as I
say, is something of a test. Tell a group of
new acquaintances some fairly well authenticated
ghost-story, and they will fall apart and
regroup in their special classes like a company
of soldiers forming up into platoons. There
will be the credulous fools on the one hand,
ready to believe anything without question;
there will be the materialist fools on the other
hand, snorting in angry contempt. Between
the two—truth is generally found midway
between extremes—between the two, preserving
a delicate balance between scepticism
and credulity, doubting the story, perhaps,
but admitting the possibility, will be the wise
men. I need hardly add, my dear fellow, that
it is among these wise philosophers that I
myself am to be found. There you have
three well-defined types, and it is noteworthy
that I am a bright specimen of the exemplary
type. If you wish to be saved you have only
to look at me and do your best.’</p>

<p>There was a gleam of laughter in Saunders’s
kindly and humorous eyes, a gleam that seemed
to apologize for having read me something in
the nature of a lecture. I had just told my
clerical friend that queer story of Bailey’s about
James Dearth and the white horse. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
interested him, and he was far more disposed
to take it seriously than I was. It started
him talking about the Unseen, a hypothesis
in which he has a more than professional
concern, and so led him to the bundle of
generalities I have just recorded. They
impressed me less than Saunders’s remarks
usually do, but I knew better than to interrupt
him. Whatever be the truth about his theory
of types, he himself is certainly a distinguished
exception to the theory. One never knows
where his talk will lead, and I for my part
always listen in the hope that it will lead to a
story. Saunders, with his penetrating vision
and his unique opportunities, has seen many
a naked soul, many a human creature stripped
bare, by triumph or catastrophe, of the coverings
that hide it from the public eye—yes, and
from the eyes of intimate friends no less. He
is as full of good stories as of bad sermons.
And so I waited now, like a timid angler
afraid even to cast in his line lest the troubling
of the waters should scare the fish away.</p>

<p>‘The surface mind is dull enough,’ continued
Saunders presently, ‘dull enough to justify a
label. It is the mysterious region below
consciousness, the rich, dark, infinitely fertile
subsoil, that passes the wit of man to understand.
For the most part, one can only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
reach it by vague conjecture. But sometimes,
here and there, some beautiful or terrible
flower shoots up from that underworld into
the light of our conscious existence. As for
your friend’s experiences at the farm, I think,
frankly, that there was sheer devilry in it,
black magic. But it isn’t always so. You
remember what I told you about poor Bellingham.’</p>

<p>In the pause that followed, my hopes
flourished exceedingly. Then I hastened to
assure Saunders that he had told me precisely
nothing at all about poor Bellingham, whose
name I heard for the first time. And so,
with a little coaxing, I got the tale from
him.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>By one of those fantastic coincidences that
make life sometimes seem more artificial than
fiction, as well as stranger (said Saunders),
it was in a little café in Rue de l’Oeil, Marseilles,
that I first noticed Bellingham. Strange
that one should have to journey to the south
of France to make the acquaintance of a
fellow-collegian! For Bellingham, too, was
a Jesus man. I had nodded to him a hundred
times in the Close, walked with him once or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
twice for a few hundred yards, and passed him
every day in the Chimney going to or from
lectures; but I knew next to nothing of him.
Once, I remember, we met in the rooms of
some other fellow and had coffee. Furnivall
was there, who afterwards made something of
a hit as an actor; Dodd who got a double
first in classics and then, before the results
were out, accidentally drowned himself within
sight of Trinity Library; Chambers who,
under a Greek pseudonym, wrote donnish
elderly witticisms for undergraduate journals.
Looking back on that inauspicious scene I
know that not one of the men I have named
possessed half the spiritual force of Bellingham,
and yet, had it not been for after-events, I
should not now have remembered that he
was there at all. He was a tall slackly-built
man, rather like a black sackful of uncoordinated
bones; he stooped a little, peering
out at the world under long bushy eyebrows
from behind a large nose. The mouth was
large and loose; the cheeks sagged a trifle;
the ears stuck out from the head at an angle
that, if you looked twice, seemed excessive;
and the hands were big and bony with long
fingers that moved, sometimes, like a piece of
murderous mechanism. It was as if the hands
of a strangler had been grafted on to the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of a morose, ungainly saint. I do not describe
him as he appeared to me in that college room:
that would be impossible, for I simply didn’t
observe him. He was no more to me then
than an uninteresting ultra-reserved fellow-student
drudging at ecclesiastical history and
similar stuff. That I failed to single him out
is sufficiently amazing to me now. My eyes
must have been in my boots. But there it is—he
made no impression on my somnolent
mind. It was not, as I say, until we met
again in that little café in Rue de l’Oeil
that I really saw Bellingham. For the thousandth
time I looked at him and for the first
time I saw him. There was quite a little
crowd of us: Hayter of Caius; Mulroyd
with his soft voice and Irish cadences; an
Oxford man whose name I’ve forgotten; and
the Honourable Somebody, a mild-mannered,
flaxen-haired boy, a Fabian socialist trying to
live down the fact that he was the younger
son of a peer. But I’m forgetting myself:
these people are merely names to you, and
names they must remain. The Oxonian was a
chance acquaintance who had encountered our
party in Paris and diffidently joined us, a
charming fellow who constantly tried—only
too successfully, for he remains in my memory
as the vaguest phantom—to efface himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Hayter, whose chief preoccupation, I remember,
was the maturing of a new Meerschaum,
played the elder brother to the flaxen-haired
youngster. Mulroyd was my own particular
friend, and it was he who had dragged in
Bellingham, the misfit of the party. Bellingham
was a curiously solitary man, a ward in
Chancery or something of the kind; no one
knew anything about his origin or antecedents,
and he had no friends. The suspicion that
he was lonely, neglected, with nowhere to
spend the Long Vacation, made him irresistible
to Mulroyd; and that he was conspicuously
unsociable Mulroyd regarded as a clarion call
of challenge to his own militant kindliness.
Well, there’s a rough sketch of the crowd that
gathered in that little red-tiled, black-raftered,
French hostel. You must imagine us all as
sitting or standing about the place, in various
negligent attitudes, drinking execrable <i>vin
rouge</i>, and talking of routes and train-services
and the comparative merits of ales. What
turned the conversation towards more ultimate
matters I cannot begin to remember, but turn
it did. I think it was our Oxonian who
interpolated some gloomy observation that set
us all thinking of a brooding, inscrutable
Destiny which for ever watched, with hard
unblinking eyes, our trivial conviviality, listened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
with infinite indifference, to our plans
of to-day and to-morrow. The remark was
succeeded by a pause that was almost a collective
shudder, a pause in which, as it seemed
to me, we all listened fixedly to our own
heart-beats ticking away the handful of moments
that divided us from an unknown
eternity. You know what it is to be recalled
suddenly, wantonly, to a sense of the immensities,
to be aware that death, an invisible
presence, is in your midst, to feel his lethal
breath chilling the warmth of your idle joy.
Even Madeleine, the daughter of the house,
who had watched us hitherto with laughter
in her dark eyes, and innocent invitation on
her full lips, was conscious of the abrupt
change of temperature. She understood not
a word of our speech, but out of the corner
of my eye I saw her hand make the sign of
the cross and her lips move in prayer. Hayter,
shockheaded, long and oval of face, ceased
fingering his pipe and seemed lost in contemplation
of its mellowing colour. A wistful
light shone in Mulroyd’s eyes. The Honourable
Somebody—I can’t recall his name—smiled
and said ‘Um.’ In that pregnant
moment during which we all sat peering over
the edge of the unfathomable, questioning the
unresponsive darkness, that monosyllable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
sounded like an incantation, a word mystical
and potent. As for me, I looked from one
face to the other, trying to read what was
written there, and so my glance fell upon
Bellingham. Fell and was arrested, for the
face of Bellingham was a revelation. What
it revealed is difficult to describe in cold
prose; a musician could better express it in
some moaning, unearthly phrase of music.
It was as if there shone from that face not
light but darkness, and as if over that head
hovered a halo of dark fear, a crown of shuddering
doom. The eyes flashed darkness, I
say, and yet through them, as through sinister
windows, I saw for one instant into the infinite
distances of the soul behind them, the unimaginable
and secret world in which the real
Bellingham, the Bellingham whom none of us
in that room had ever seen or approached,
lived his isolated life. He was leaning forward,
elbows on knees, his chin propped up in
those gaunt skeleton hands that were several
sizes too big for him. To me, who stood
facing him, the effect was incredibly bizarre:
it was for all the world as though some monster
whose face was hidden from me was crouching
at my feet offering the truncated head of
Bellingham for my acceptance. The red-knuckled
fingers formed a fitting cup for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
grotesque sacrifice. I put the horrible fancy
behind me and sought to regain a human view
of that face. Gaunt and pallid, with high
cheekbones and burning eyes, it was a battle-ground
of conflicting passions. But the natures
and names of the passions I could only surmise.
An ascetic and a voluptuary, perhaps, had
fought in Bellingham, and his face was the
neutral ground that their warfare had violated
and laid waste. The merest conjecture, this,
and it remained so, until it was proved to be
false.</p>

<p>‘It doesn’t bear thinking of,’ remarked
Hayter, ‘so it’s best to avoid the thought.
The animals are better off than we, by a long
chalk.’</p>

<p>‘There’s religion,’ said the flaxen-haired
Fabian tentatively.</p>

<p>‘Soothing syrup,’ Hayter murmured.
‘Religion doesn’t face death: it only pretends
it isn’t there. Gateway to the larger life, and
all that cant.’ Hayter was a very positive
young man in his way.</p>

<p>Mulroyd tried to banter us back into a more
comfortable humour. ‘Material for a first-rate
shindy there. Now then, Saunders, speak
up for your cloth, my boy!’</p>

<p>‘I shall, when I’ve got it,’ said I. A
theological student does not care to talk shop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
in mixed company. I was shy of posing as a
preacher, and not to be drawn.</p>

<p>‘Well, if Saunders won’t, I will.’</p>

<p>The voice was harsh, and tense with emotion.
It seemed to come out of the grave
itself. We all stared at Bellingham, whom
we had become accustomed to regard as almost
incapable of contributing to a conversation.
We waited. Hayter even forgot that work of
chromatic art, his pipe.</p>

<p>‘Death waits for every man,’ said Bellingham.
‘At any moment it may engulf us.’
The triteness of the sermon was redeemed by
the personality that blazed in the speaker.
‘And then....’ His voice trailed off into
silence.</p>

<p>‘And then?’ enquired Hayter, with a
politeness that I fancied covered a sneer.</p>

<p>‘And then,’ said the man of doom, ‘we
shall find ourselves in the terrible presence of
God.’</p>

<p>For once even the genial Mulroyd was stung
to sarcasm. ‘I must say, judging from your
tone, you don’t seem to relish the prospect
much.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind what I relish,’ answered
Bellingham sternly. ‘In that hour you and
I will be judged. We shall be forced to look
into the eye that at this moment, and always,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
is looking upon us.’ There was an uncomfortable
silence, as well there might be. We
had not reckoned upon such an explosion of
evangelical fervour, and it embarrassed us as
some flagrant breach of manners would have
done. Perhaps, heaven help us, we regarded
it as a flagrant breach of manners. Bellingham
was committing the cardinal sin: he was
taking something too seriously.</p>

<p>‘When I was a child,’ went on Bellingham,
without ruth, ‘I was told the story of a prisoner
condemned to solitary confinement. To this
punishment was added the further horror of
perpetual watching. A small hole was drilled
in the cell-door through which an eye never
ceased to peer at the prisoner. That was an
allegory, and I have never forgotten it. Even
now, you fellows, we are being watched.’</p>

<p>Some of us, I swear, looked round nervously,
half expecting to catch sight of that
vigilant eye. I, for my part, was angry.
‘That’s not an allegory, Bellingham,’ I said.
‘It’s a damned travesty. You conceive God
to be a kind of Peeping Tom, with omnipotence
added. I would rather be an atheist than
believe that.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you would rather be an atheist,’
retorted Bellingham. ‘Perhaps I would rather
be an atheist. But I can’t be. Nor can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
you. Did any of you notice the name of
the street?’</p>

<p>‘Name of the street?’ echoed some one.
‘What street?’</p>

<p>‘This street,’ said Bellingham.</p>

<p>‘We’re not in a street. We’re in a café,’
said Hayter truculently. ‘At least I thought
so a moment ago. I begin to fancy we must
be in a mission-hall.’</p>

<p>At the moment no one could remember
having noticed the name. ‘Well, I did notice
it,’ said Bellingham. ‘It is the Street of the
Eye.’</p>

<p>Mulroyd shrugged his shoulders, a gesture
plainly disdainful of this touch of melodrama.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said I, ‘what of it?’ For the
fellow’s morbidity had spoiled my temper.
I expected a night of bad dreams.</p>

<p>‘The Street of the Eye,’ repeated Bellingham.
‘We’re all in that street; every man
born is in that street. And we shall never
get out of it.’</p>

<p>I believe some of us half-suspected that the
wine had gone to his head, though how such
stuff could make any man tipsy was beyond
understanding. He continued to irradiate
gloom upon us from under his shaggy brows.
Mulroyd, to create a diversion, held out his
hands to Madeleine in mock appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>‘Du vin, mademoiselle! Nous sommes
bien chagrinés.’</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes brightened again. At the
merest hint of a renewal of gaiety she rose,
radiantly, as if from the dead.</p>

<p>‘Let’s have some champagne,’ Mulroyd
suggested, ‘to take the taste of death out of
our mouths.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Carpe diem</i>,’ murmured Hayter. ‘Trite.
But the first and last word of wisdom.’</p>

<p>‘You can’t escape that way,’ remarked
Bellingham, sourly insistent.</p>

<p>But we could stand no more of Bellingham
just then. Flinging courtesy to the winds we
laughed and sang and shouted him down.
‘Death be damned!’ cried Mulroyd, as we
clinked glasses. Never was a toast drunk
with more fervour.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised when I say that after
this incident I got to know Bellingham better
and to like him more. Strange as it may
seem, he was not entirely without humour;
and I fancied that he was the least bit ashamed
of his outburst. The next day he went about
like a dog in disgrace, feeling perhaps that
every one disliked him. Back he went into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
that shell of silence from which he had only
once, and with such dramatic effect, emerged.
He would never, I know, have gone back on
the substance of his discourse; but, as he
admitted to me afterwards, he very quickly
began to doubt the wisdom of his method.
Fellow-undergraduates were not to be frightened
into conversion by the kind of revivalist
rant he had treated us to. He began to feel
woefully out of place in our company. Mulroyd,
good fellow though he was, could not
bring himself to make any warm overtures to
one whom he now regarded as a religious
maniac; on the surface he was breezy and
friendly enough, but in his heart he knew that
Bellingham must be reckoned among his
failures, one who had failed to justify his ardent
faith in the latent social value of every man.
The others ignored him, though not pointedly,
much as they had always done. My own attitude
was different. I have, as you know, an
insatiable curiosity about human nature—especially
freaks of human nature, I’m afraid—and
Bellingham had piqued that curiosity.
I had repudiated his particular version of God
as being nothing but an almighty Peeping
Tom, and yet a weakness for peeping is my own
besetting sin. All my life I have been a kind
of amateur detective of the human soul. Moreover—though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
I don’t stress this—I had more
than a sneaking sympathy for the man. After
all we had something in common, something
that none of the others of our party shared
with us. We were both hoping to be ordained.
In spite of myself I had to admire the colossal
courage of his intervention in that argument,
even while I disparaged its tone. In fine,
for this reason and for that, I made rather
a point of cultivating Bellingham’s acquaintance
from that day forth. And I had my
reward. I really believe that to me he revealed
a more human side of himself than anybody
else ever caught sight of. Next term, back
at college, he made a habit of strolling into
my rooms at five minutes to ten, and very
often we talked till the early hours of the
morning about this and that. Sometimes he
became reminiscent about his childhood. His
earliest memories were of a grey suburban
villa, with a black square patch in front and a
black oblong patch behind, both called gardens.
The square one was marked off from the
road by hideous iron railings and an iron gate.
Bellingham assured me that the pattern of those
railings was branded on his retina; and in an
unwonted lapse from literalism he declared
that it was a pattern designed in hell and
executed in Bedlam. ‘Wherever I see it,’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
said passionately, under the influence of nothing
more potent than black coffee, ‘wherever
I see it—and it is all over southeast London—I
recognize the mark of the beast, the signature
of an incorrigible stupidity. The very smell
of those railings is noisome.’ He was like
that: ever ready to see material things as
symbols of the unseen, and very prone—like
many religionists—to confuse the symbol with
the thing symbolized. In the sheer exuberance
of his passion, whether of joy or disgust, he
would make some wild exaggerated statement
that no one was expected to take literally; and
the next moment he himself would be taking
it literally. If, for example, I had suggested
to him that to talk of the smell of railings was a
trifle fanciful, he would have been genuinely
astonished. Whenever he loved or hated,
rationality went to the winds. And he seems
to have hated the home of his childhood pretty
completely. The back garden, where he
spent a good deal of his time, figured in his talk
as if it were a plague spot, an evil blot upon
the earth. If one is to believe his tale, this
garden was always, in season and out, full of
wet flapping underclothes hanging on a line.
They used to lie in wait for him, he said, and
smack him in the face: it was like being
embraced by a slimy fish. He was glad, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of the clothes-line posts; he used to
climb them and swing from the cross-bars, and
once or twice he pulled one of these posts out
of its wooden socket in the ground and stared
down at the minute wriggling monsters that
scuttled about in that little twilit world.
Another thing that gave him pleasure was the
sight of a neighbouring church, aspiring towards
the sky, the throne of God. These memories
may well have derived much of their colour
from imagination, for both his parents died
before he was ten, and he then left the suburban
villa to become the ward of his uncle Joseph.
Joseph Bellingham appears to have been
conspicuously unfitted for the delicate task of
bringing up a sensitive, solitary, and already
morbid child, although not a word against him
would his nephew have admitted. Justly or
unjustly I was disposed to believe that this
Uncle Joseph had completed the dark work
begun in Bellingham by his childish solitude
and loveless home. For his parents, I should
have told you, were lifeless, disillusioned people.
I suspect they had never been happy or
passionate lovers, and that they regarded their
son’s birth as one more penalty rather than as
the desired fruit of their marriage. In some
preposterous way (naturally Bellingham was
reticent here) the man had sacrificed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
in marrying his wife—some fetish of ‘honour’
perhaps—and of course he spent the rest of
his life hating her for it. This may or may not
account for the fact that when I first got to
know Bellingham he seemed extraordinarily
insensitive, for a man of his temperament, to
beauty. Not totally deficient—because even
his hatred of a certain kind of iron railings
implies some standard, however subconscious—but
what sense of beauty he possessed had
never been wakened: it manifested itself only
in a series of dislikes. He had quite a devilish
flair for seeing the most repulsive aspect of
things. This was all in tune with his miserable
theology. To the spiritual loveliness that
radiates from the central figure of the New
Testament—to that beacon he was as blind
as he was deaf to the many golden promises of
the religion of Christ. I do not mean that he
swerved by a hair’s breadth from orthodoxy;
I mean that there was some subtle twist in his
temperament that made him accept ‘the love
of God’ as a euphemism and ‘the wrath of
God’ as a terrible reality. He thought more
about hell than about heaven, because he had
only seen beauty whereas he had <i>felt</i> ugliness.
The one was an intellectual apprehension:
the other was a perpetual experience. It was
evident to me, from what he did not say, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
he had never known love, and I wondered
what was in store for him.</p>

<p>But though with me he became more and
more unreserved, from all other fellows of his
class and education he drew farther away.
There was a spiritual uncouthness in him which
prevented his taking kindly to the harmless
social artificialities of academic life. As I told
him—and he admitted it good-humouredly—he
would have been more at home as chief
medicine-man to a tribe of barbarians. In
some remote and savage bush his niche awaited
him. Even the traditions of politeness he
grew to despise. I shocked him by admitting
that I myself had more than once got out of
accepting an invitation to breakfast or to coffee
by feigning to be engaged elsewhere. Bellingham
would have said bluntly, ‘No, thanks,’
and have left it at that. Courageous, no doubt,
but it did not make for easy social relations.
He became more and more dissatisfied, too,
with the mild fashionable Anglicanism of our
dean. Of his own religion sensationalism was
the life-breath; and the worship of good form,
the religion of all undergraduates, was in his
eyes the most dangerous idolatry. No one was
surprised when, having taken his degree with
the rest of us, he abruptly left the University.
Instead of being ordained he became just what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
I had chaffingly suggested, a medicine-man
to a tribe of barbarians. To be more exact,
he set up as a lay-missioner near the Euston
Road. He had a meagre but sufficient private
income which permitted him to go his own
solitary gait. And there he busied himself
wrestling with the Devil for the souls of all
the miscellaneous street-scum he could lay
hands on. God forgive me if I have ever in
my heart derided Bellingham! He had the
heroism as well as the mania of a one-idea’d
man. I find it hard to suppose that his converts
were any the happier for having been
injected with his particular virus of fear; but,
as Bellingham would say, where happiness cannot
be reconciled to salvation happiness must
go. Go it did, I have no doubt. Fear of the
policeman was displaced by a scarcely less
ignoble fear of God, conceived to be another
policeman on a much larger scale. If I speak
bitterly, it is not in spite of my religion but
because of it. Before I have finished the story
you will understand that I have cause for
bitterness.</p>

<p>We exchanged a few letters, he and I; but
it was not until eighteen months later that, at
his own invitation, I went to see him. ‘Saunders,
I need your help,’ he said in his letter,
and added something about my being his only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
real friend and so on. He had dismal little
lodgings in a dismal little side-street the name
of which I have forgotten. Bellingham himself
opened the door to me. I had told him
when to expect me and he must have been
waiting at the window. He greeted me in a
shamefaced eager fashion that touched my
heart. I was astonished at the change in him:
the more astonished because it was at once
subtle and impossible to miss. There was a
gentleness in his eyes that I had never seen
there before. He was more human. He led
me to his own rooms—they were at the top of a
four-storied house, and looked out on a prospect
of smoking chimneys—and forced me into the
only comfortable chair he possessed.</p>

<p>I began smoking, but he denied himself
that nerve-soothing indulgence. His eyes,
alight with an unwonted shyness that was only
half shame, avoided meeting mine. We fenced
for a while, talking over our Jesus days; and
all the while my mind, involuntarily, was seeking
a name for something in that room that
I had not expected to find. Presently Bellingham
rose from his chair. It was an abrupt
and surprising movement. ‘Like to see the
rest of my quarters?’ he said, in a tone desperately
casual. I followed him into the next
room, and there, in one glance, the mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
was made clear. The bedroom was the answer
to the problem of the sitting-room. What I
had detected while we sat talking was domesticity,
a subtle but decided fragrance of home:
a certain precision in the arrangement of books
and furniture. In the bedroom, with its two
spotlessly white-sheeted beds and its vase of
flowers standing in the centre of a miniature
dressing-table, the same story was told more
eloquently; there was, accentuated, aggressive,
the same neatness and daintiness of effect which
a contented woman instinctively imposes on
her surroundings. No bachelor, however
fastidious, could have achieved it. ‘Quite a
jolly little place,’ I remarked, to hide my own
surprise and his embarrassment. ‘Very,’ said
Bellingham, and we went back to our seats by
the fire.</p>

<p>Bellingham tried to take up the thread of
our conversation where we had dropped it five
minutes before. But for his own sake I cut
off that line of retreat.</p>

<p>‘Look here, my dear fellow! You didn’t
ask me over here in order to discuss our
esteemed Dr. Morgan. Tell me all about it.’</p>

<p>Bellingham faced me squarely at last. ‘You
mean my marriage?’ I nodded. ‘Well, to
start with, I’m not married.’</p>

<p>I think he expected me to flinch at that;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and perhaps my failure to do so disconcerted
as well as encouraged him. I said nothing.
I felt that I could do more good by listening
than by talking.</p>

<p>‘She has been in these rooms for two months,’
said Bellingham. ‘And what you saw in there—that
has existed for ten days, just ten days.’
I divined that this was his way of indicating
to me the duration of his married life. ‘You
see I didn’t fall at once, or easily. The Devil
is always insidious, isn’t he? Saunders, that
girl is a magician. Joan, her name is. She
transformed this place. It’s not bad now, is
it? You should have seen it before she came.
And me, too—you should have seen me before
she came. It’s a new life to me. I’m translated.
And yet....’</p>

<p>‘How and where did you meet her?’</p>

<p>‘In the street, at the beginning of November.
Her husband kicked her out. A swine he is;
thank God I’ve never set eyes on him. Told
her to go and sell herself, and come back with
her earnings.’</p>

<p>There was a pause. ‘And she?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘She was on the streets for five days. Yes,
a prostitute for five days.’ I saw Bellingham’s
face contract with pain, and I knew that something
deeper than pity had been stirred in him.
And so the recital went on. Bit by bit I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
his story and pieced it together. He did not
spare himself; but even his passion for repentance,
his ingrained conviction of sin, could
not persuade me that he had been guilty of a
very heinous crime. He had rescued the girl,
at first in sheer compassion, and cherished her
as he would have cherished any other fragment
of human salvage. And her presence, her
pathetic prettiness and her childish need of
affection, had been too much for him. In a
passion of gratitude, I surmise, she had offered
him, with a full heart, what she had so reluctantly
sold to casual men during her five days
purgatory. The appeal to his manhood was
too sudden, too overwhelming, to be resisted.
Beauty, seen for the first time in dazzling glory,
had invaded his heart and beaten down his
defences. For the first time in my experience
of him there was inconsistency in Bellingham.
He spoke, one minute, of his ‘fall,’ like any sour
moralist; and in his very next sentence he
would become almost lyrical about this ‘new
life,’ this shattering apocalypse of beauty. It
was as if the man had been cloven in twain
and spoke with two voices. And that, I believe,
is the real key to the baffling terror that was
to follow.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, in time to prepare
tea for us, came Joan herself, a big-eyed child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in her early ’twenties, with very fair hair, like a
little lost angel with a Cockney accent. The
sudden fear that leaped into her eyes as she
timidly greeted me would have stabbed any
man’s heart. She was absurdly fragile, and
I saw at once that those five evil days had
been no more than a gruesome physical accident
which had left her courage shaken but her
innocence unimpaired. She guessed, no doubt,
that we had been discussing her; and both
Bellingham and I felt caddish, I dare say, when
we remembered having done so. But I succeeded
in winning her confidence by displaying
a keen interest in her market-basket, which she
carried on her arm, and in a very few moments
she became garrulous about her shopping
experiences, displaying a pretty pride in her
purchases. They included, I remember, three
dried herrings and a pound of pig’s-fry. The
herrings we had for our tea, and I have never
enjoyed a meal more.</p>

<p>In the evening, during a long walk through
mean streets, Bellingham came to the point.
He had said, you will remember, that he needed
my help. What he wanted was no less than
that I should play the part of conscience to
him. I was to be instated, apparently, as his
spiritual pastor. For the sake of that poor
child happily darning his socks at home, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
could not refuse the embarrassing honour
thrust upon me. And when I learned that
repentance was actually beginning to gain the
upper hand of him I was glad indeed to exert any
influence I possessed on the side of humanity.
He had had a vile dream, he told me, and it
was evident that he regarded it as a warning
sent by that vigilant deity of his. In the
dream his landlady, who believed him to be a
legally married man, came and smiled at him
over the bedrail, and wagged her head till it
detached itself from the body and multiplied.
The air was full of these grinning heads, poised
like dragonflies, all their evil eyes on Bellingham.
Terror, he told me, took concrete form
inside his own head: he could hear it simmering,
sizzling, gurgling, boiling, splitting; it
drove him out of bed, away from Joan, and
across the arid plains of hell under a sky
monotonously grey except where the sun, a
bloody red, like a huge socket from which the
eye had been torn, stared sightlessly at him.
Even as he gazed at it it filled and became
menacing with the eye of God.</p>

<p>‘It was a vision of hell,’ Bellingham said,
wiping the moisture from his brow. ‘And
the eye of God was even there. O Lord,
how can I escape from Thy presence!’</p>

<p>It did not seem to me a moment propitious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
for argument, so I held my peace. He talked
on about his doubts and his difficulties, his sin
and his repentance; and at last I gathered
that I was being invited to tell him whether
he should stay with Joan or leave her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, fling her into the streets,’ I advised
him, with furious irony, ‘as her husband did.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said, mildly enough. ‘You’re
right. Against all my religious convictions I
feel you to be right. I have made her my wife,
and I must be faithful to my choice, right or
wrong.’</p>

<p>‘It’s as plain as day,’ I assured him. ‘Love
and duty are pointing in the same direction
for once. Why should you doubt it?’</p>

<p>‘You see, Saunders,’ said Bellingham, with
sudden fire, ‘it’s all or nothing. She must
remain my wife, or we must separate. There’s
no third way. I can’t spend the rest of my
life in the waters of Tantalus. I’m only a
man, God help me!’</p>

<p>For a while we left it at that.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Saunders has an exasperating habit of stopping
in the middle of a story, and behaving
as though it were finished. He did this now.
I reminded him that I was still listening....
No, I haven’t done yet, he admitted. I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
that was the end, but it was only the beginning
of poor Bellingham’s troubles. You must
imagine me now as popping in and out of his
home pretty often. Those two remote rooms,
like a fantastic nest built among London
chimney-pots, attracted me by the romance
they symbolized, by their air of being an idyllic
peasant cottage, exquisitely clean, stuck away
in the heart of the metropolis. Bellingham
sent another urgent summons to me. It was
the first of a series of alarms. The haunting
began. The dreams that, every few nights,
made Bellingham’s sleep a thing of terror began
now to invade his waking life. The Watching
Eye was upon him, the eye of God, he declared
it to be, trying to subdue him to submission.
He heard a voice that said to him, ‘Put the
woman from you.’ In short, he exhibited all
the signs of incipient madness. At the time
I thought it was indeed madness which threatened
him. With one of his frantic telegrams
in my hand—‘I have seen God’ or ‘He is
come again in judgment’—what else could I
think? Yet I still believed that together he
and I, with the courageous co-operation of Joan
herself, might fend off the danger. She, poor
girl, was tearful but invincibly staunch. She
would have sacrificed herself utterly for him,
whom she loved with an unshakable devotion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
but I persuaded her that her going away, as
she suggested, would not ease the situation.
You will think me fanciful, no doubt, but
sometimes I felt that Bellingham was fighting
for his soul against some usurping demon, and
that anything—death or damnation—was better
than base surrender. And Bellingham, though
he took a very different view of the nature of
the contest, came to agree with my conclusion.
He rejected my proposition but embraced the
corollary. He conceived himself fighting
against impossible odds, with no less than God,
the Might and Majesty of the universe, as his
implacable antagonist. ‘I tell you, Saunders,’
he said to me, ‘I saw Him plainly. He stood
over there by my desk. He has incarnated
Himself once more in order to crush my revolt.’
I passed over the almost maniacal egoism of
the conception, and asked for a description of
the Divine Visitor. ‘His body was all in
strong shadow,’ Bellingham answered, shuddering
at the recollection. ‘Only His terrible
eyes were visible, and His accusing finger that
pointed at me.’</p>

<p>I had respected Bellingham ever since I had
come to know him; and now, if I respected
his intelligence less, I felt something more than
admiration for the indomitable spirit of the
man. His unshaken belief that he was defying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
his Creator made fidelity to Joan a piece of
titanic courage. Beset by horrors unspeakable,
conscious that the citadel of his very reason
was being stormed, he yet held doggedly to
his determination. Doggedly at first, and
afterwards with a sublime pride that I could
not witness without an answering pride, a
flaming exultation in the splendour of the
human soul. Maniac or not, he extorted willing
homage from me. You may say what
you like about hallucination and the rest of
it, but I tell you that to me, an eye-witness, the
battle was lifted into the realm of cosmic
drama where everything takes on a significance
past mortal understanding but not past mortal
apprehension. I thought of Job; I thought
of Prometheus; and I thought of Bellingham
as no mean third, championing life against
death, championing youth, beauty, and all frail
humanity, against the cruel bogey of the mind
that menaced them. It goes without saying
that his terrors derived all their power from
his belief in their reality. He was blind to the
plain facts of real religion, deaf to my rationalizing
explanations of the horror that haunted
him, obstinate in his conviction that God, and
none other, was the author and agent of his
persecution. Equally convinced was he that
he had but to cast Joan out and he would save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
his soul alive. Every week saw a change in
his physical condition. That brief period of
his second blooming, fostered by the sweet
presence and the maternal care of Joan, seemed
over for ever; it was as if the seven years of
spiritual famine were now to follow. He grew
more gaunt, more haggard; vitality shrunk
into him like a pent prisoner and peered out
through those fiery orbs, his eyes, as through
the mean windows of a condemned cell. He
was locked fast in an impregnable isolation,
from which no one could rescue him, it seemed,
certainly not I, either by force or guile. He
distrusted his food; he distrusted the men
and women who passed him in the street.
There were only two human souls he did not
distrust: Joan herself was one, and I, by the
mercy of heaven, was the other. He began to
see a vast and sinister significance in all sorts
of trivial events, all sorts of minor disasters
that did not in the least concern any one of us,
seeing in them the beginning of a cosmic
disintegration that should engulf him in perdition.
He was afraid yet defiant of these
fatalities. He was both egomaniacal and illogical
in his conviction that God, his implacable
adversary, would behave like the veriest
villain of melodrama rather than let him escape:
tear the universe to tatters in order to compass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the death or the dishonour of this one rebellious
spirit, like a man who should pull his own
house about his ears in the pursuit of a solitary
rat. I myself began to scan the papers anxiously
for wars and rumours of wars. Different as
were our intellectual convictions, there was the
stark comradeship between us of those who
face death together. He watched for signs of
God; Joan and I, with equal vigilance, watched
him. And the stronger grew my affection for
Bellingham, the shakier my own nerves became.
Finally, with a kind of exultation, I threw up
all my work—I was a curate at the time—and
flung myself body and soul into this holy war.
I found lodgings near Bellingham’s, and visited
him every day without fail. I felt that this
fretting, this piling of horror upon horror,
could not go on much longer. Sooner or later
there would be a crisis; the increasing tension
would snap. Mingled with my fear for Bellingham’s
sanity was a fear for the safety of
Joan, caged up with a maniac. For a week
or more we worried and waited.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The end came with a sudden and sickening
rush. And yet it was an end worth waiting
and working for. In the street just outside his
home, Bellingham was knocked down by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
passing cab. Joan saw the accident from the
window. By the sheerest chance he escaped with
nothing worse than bruises and flesh wounds,
but his excitement and terror reached their
climax as he was helped back, limp and bleeding,
to his rooms. The policeman, with a
kindly word, handed him over to Joan’s care.
She was all for summoning a doctor, but Bellingham
would not hear of it. White-faced,
hiding his rising tumult behind a mask of steely
calm, he told her curtly to fetch me. She
obeyed, poor child, in terror of her life and his
own. I was with them ten minutes later.</p>

<p>‘Saunders,’ he greeted me, without preamble.
‘God has flung down His last challenge.’</p>

<p>‘You mean this accident!’ said I, scoffing
gently.</p>

<p>‘Accident!’ retorted Bellingham. ‘Do
you, a priest of God, talk to me of accident!
Not a sparrow falls without God. No, it was
no accident. It was the last warning. I feel
in my bones that this is the end. At any
moment now He will strike, and I shall burn
in hell for ever more, where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched.’ He had
the true missioner’s flow of quotations, mostly
misapplied; but I knew better than to cross
him then. Something of his own passion
infected me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>We were standing in the bedroom, where
he was at last submitting, with the most
complete indifference, to the medical ministrations
of Joan. ‘Let’s go into the other
room,’ I suggested, ‘and discuss this quietly
and in comfort.’ I led the way, and they
followed. The living-room, as I fancy they
called it, was more cheerful by a long way.
There was a fire in the grate, and a lamp like
a great harvest moon glowed yellow on the
table.</p>

<p>‘Listen to me, Saunders,’ cried Bellingham,
refusing to sit down. ‘You are my best
friend, my only friend; and Joan is my wife,
the finest wife that any man had. The All-Seeing
Eye is watching me now, as always;
that street-accident, as you call it, was the
plain speech of God telling me to desert this
woman. I’m a doomed man, Saunders, and I
can speak my mind now. I believe in God as
firmly as ever I believed in Him, but I have
learned something. He is not worth serving.
I tell you, Saunders, that the God we have
both worshipped is as evil as He is powerful.
Almighty Evil sits upon the throne of the
universe, and I will curse Him and die.’ Poor
fellow, he could not believe me when I told
him that it was the God in himself that was
speaking those wild words, the God in himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
that was fighting a heroic battle against the
demon of fear that Joan by her woman’s
tenderness had cast out.</p>

<p>There came, suddenly, a crash of something
falling in one of the lower rooms of the house.
It jarred our tense nerves horribly. And
then, for the last time, the terror came to
Bellingham, as if in answer to his taunt. He
alone saw it, and you will quickly interpose
that it was his mind alone that created it. And
in a sense I believe you are right, but you’ll find
it hard before I finish to maintain that the
apparition was a purely subjective thing. Can
an hallucination cause windows to rattle and
doors to move? I believe for my part that
in some unfathomable way the old Bellingham,
or rather the riot of evil fancies about God
that had victimized the old Bellingham, had
woven for itself some external form. Language
is crude and clumsy, crushing the truth at
which it grasps; but it seems to me that in
some sense—and a sense not too metaphorical—the
man was, as I said before, cloven in
twain, divided against himself. But your face
warns me that I’m boring you.</p>

<p>‘There it is,’ shouted Bellingham, pointing
towards a corner of the room. Joan, afraid
of her lover, rushed to me, and my arms closed
round her instinctively. We stared and saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
nothing. ‘The same evil eyes,’ said Bellingham,
more quietly, ‘the same accusing finger.’
And then began an uncanny one-sided colloquy.
Bellingham conversed with his invisible mentor.
‘I will not leave her, God,’ said Bellingham.
‘I despise your dirty counsels. Kill me, damn
me, burn me. Send me to hell, where I may
see your hateful staring face no more.’</p>

<p>The windows began unaccountably to rattle.
Joan clung to me, sobbing, on the verge of
hysteria. Bellingham strode towards the table
and with one swift gesture put out the light.
‘I am not afraid of your darkness,’ he flung
out.</p>

<p>For a moment, silence; and a darkness made
ghastly by bright moonlight. Then the windows
rattled again, and then, quite without
warning, Bellingham collapsed and fell against
me. My body had broken his fall, and I now
released Joan in order to turn my attention to
her lover. The sight of him prostrate restored
her to courage. She was always ready when
needed. I left Bellingham to her care for a
moment and turned again to that haunted
corner. I have never known fear such as I
knew at that moment, and yet I felt infinitely
braced by the dramatic significance of this
conflict with an unknown terror. It was as if
hell had invaded earth, and that God had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
left me as His sole witness. At such crises a
man with religion turns to it. Your old-fashioned
agnosticism will be shocked by my
method of exorcising evil.</p>

<p>‘In the Name of God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy Ghost, I charge you to
leave this man in peace!’ I made the sign of
the cross.</p>

<p>And still I stared, and still I saw nothing.
Joan was busy with Bellingham, who was
beginning to shew signs of returning consciousness.
I could not move my eyes away from
the corner by the door. And while I stared,
something at last happened. Thank Heaven
that I alone saw it! The door leading to the
bedroom, which had been left half-open, began
closing. It closed, pulled to from the other
side, and the knob moved and the catch
clicked, as though released from the hand of
the Unseen. I ran to it, opened it, and
looked out. And saw—nothing at all.</p>

</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">HARRIET leaned across the scullery sink,
where dirty plates were soaking, in
order to get a better view of the moon. Her
sleeves were turned up to the elbow. Her
right hand grasped a ball of dishcloth from
which slimy water oozed between her red
fingers to float, in black spots, upon the surface
of the water. Upon that water, through which
projected a tureen, like the bows of a wrecked
ship, the moonlight fell. The three and
elevenpenny alarum clock in the kitchen began
striking nine.</p>

<p>All Harriet’s spiritual crises had had for
their <i>mise-en-scène</i> this scullery, or so it
seemed to Harriet herself. Seven years earlier
she had stood where she was now standing and
had wrestled with overmastering fear, to the
accompaniment of that same ticking clock and
to the drip-drip from the plate-rack upon
already washed spoons. She had leaned then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
across the sink, as she was leaning now, and
stared in terror at an unearthly glow in the
sky that could scarcely fail to mean the end
of the world and the coming of God in judgment.
She shuddered to picture the dead
bodies, putty-coloured, rising in their shrouds
to confront—with her and Mamma and Alice
and Maud—an implacable Creator. ‘O God,
don’t come yet!’ It had been the most
spontaneous of all her prayers. She had heard
too much of this God to trust herself readily
to His mercy; and she, the most wicked of
girls, had little enough to hope from mere
justice. She had too often deceived her
teacher and been unsympathetic with her poor
mother; and far too often had she resented
having to drudge in the house—sweep and
dust, make beds, empty slops, and wash dirty
dinner-things—while still at school, and to the
neglect of her home-lessons.</p>

<p>Whether in answer to her prayer, or from
come other cause, God had stayed His coming
on that occasion, and to-night, within a week
of her twentieth birthday, she was thinking of
quite other things: not of God, but of the
moon. There was something placid and
sisterly to-night about that celestial presence,
and Harriet was deliciously aware of a bond
between them, ‘Because Geoff likes us both,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
she said in her heart. What had been his
phrase, the phrase that had astonished her
first to gladness? ‘Gentle as moonlight, soft
and gentle as moonlight.’ The words haunted
her memory like singing birds. Geoff’s liking
was in itself strange enough: the degree of
his liking was scarcely credible. Why had he
no eyes for Alice, the acknowledged beauty
of the family?—or for Maud, with her brains?
‘Cinderella and the Ugly Sisters,’ Geoff had
said. But Cinderella had been a pretty girl,
and she, Harriet, was all too plain. It could
only have been kindness or perverse obstinacy
that had made him deny that. She glanced
into the tiny mirror that hung from a nail on
the pink distempered wall, and examined with
some distaste the oval olive face, the fair
hair, and the large brown eyes that looked
out at her. Tears began to form in those eyes.
‘Now don’t start that silliness!’ she admonished
herself. And she returned to the
practical world and to the washing of the
things dirtied at supper. ‘I do wish mamma
wouldn’t leave all her fat,’ she thought, as
with her scullery knife she sped three quivering
fragments into the waste-pail.</p>

<p>There remained the undeniable fact that
Geoff wanted to marry her: that is, he liked
her so much that he wished her to share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
his home, when he acquired one, and wash his
dishes instead of her mother’s. She could
cook, too: she could make him nice things;
and she would indeed have cheerfully slaved
for his comfort in gratitude for that pity
which, as she supposed, had made his glance
linger in kindness upon her. But that was
not to be. Even in that wonderful moment
when he praised her gentleness she had
realized how impossible it was that she should
leave mamma; and her sisters had been not
slow to emphasize that impossibility. ‘Boy
and girl flirtation,’ said Alice with genial
contempt—unaccountably, since Geoff was
twenty-six and considered to be rather a clever
young man. He was a poet—a bank-clerk
in his spare time—and his knack of finding
rhymes should alone have earned him some
respect. To Geoff himself Alice had always
been conspicuously friendly; and as for Maud—he
had been her friend in the first place (she
had met him in the city), and it had always
been assumed that it was Maud whom he came
to see. But about Geoff’s intentions now
there could be no doubt at all. He had even
wanted, the dear silly, to help Harriet wash
up, but she had not dared to allow that,
and he, making a virtue of necessity, was at
this moment closeted with the family, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
urging once more his extravagant claim.</p>

<p>The last dish dried, the last fork placed in
its proper section of the plate-basket, she returned,
rather shamefaced, to the sitting-room.
As the door closed behind her an
ominous hush fell. A smile upon the proud
plump face of Alice froze hard and thawed
suddenly. Maud swung round upon the
revolving music-stool and began turning the
pages of Mendelssohn’s <i>Lieder</i>. Her mother,
perched insecurely on the edge of her chair,
visibly suffered. She was always visibly
suffering.</p>

<p>‘Girls!’ said mamma plaintively.... It
was enough. Harriet’s sisters rose without a
word and left the room. Mamma looked at
the young man, but he made no movement.
‘Geoffrey!’ she said, a world of pathos in her
voice. But Geoffrey was deaf to it. ‘This
concerns me too,’ he said. ‘May I smoke?’</p>

<p>‘Very well. Stay, if you wish to be cruel....’
But this man, lost to all sense of humanity,
only replied: ‘I’m vulgarly persistent, no
doubt, but you see I happen to want Harry.’</p>

<p>Harry’s mother turned twin orbs of suffering
upon her daughter, and began reciting the
speech she had prepared.</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry, Harriet, to disappoint you. I
understand your desire to get away from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
troublesome invalid mother and your two
bread-winning sisters. But you are God’s
charge to me and I must protect you.’</p>

<p>‘From me?’ inquired Geoffrey.</p>

<p>She did not heed the interruption.</p>

<p>‘I say nothing against Geoffrey, but I
can’t consent to anything in the shape of an
engagement between you. For one thing
you are as yet a mere girl; you know nothing
of life and nothing of marriage. And that
isn’t all. Geoffrey has told me something
very sad. He has been very open and frank
with me: I <i>will</i> say that for him. We all
like Geoffrey. But he’s told me that he
would wish to be married in an office. He has
queer views, my dear. He even tells me that
he only goes to church to please his mother
and father. I’m afraid he’s let go of the
Saviour’s hand altogether. After that, I need
hardly say more. I know my little Harriet
too well to believe that she can wish to give
mother pain. I already have my Cross to
bear.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, mamma.’ Harriet’s eyes were
luminous with tears.</p>

<p>At that Geoffrey rose. ‘Then I’d better
clear off home at once.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Geoffrey,’ protested his hostess,
‘I know you are thinking to spare my feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
after this upset. You’re very good to me
always. But you’ll please stay your week-end.
We mustn’t part in unfriendliness—and you
know how I should hate you to travel on
Sunday.’</p>

<p>He could not keep bitterness out of his
smile, but he replied cheerfully enough:</p>

<p>‘Well, Mrs. Mason, since Harry is not to
be engaged to me there’ll be no harm in my
taking her out for half an hour before bed?
Would you care to come, Harry?... Thanks
awfully.’</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Harriet went to her room in a trembling
ecstasy, struggling against odds to believe that
she was indeed beautiful, as he had said. While
she moved about, within the pink beflowered
walls of her very own room (as in her heart
she was wont to call it), his voice still made
music in her memory.</p>

<p>‘Why will you submit to be boxed up in
that prison? Can’t you understand how I
want you? Can’t you understand how lovely
you are?’ He had never before been so
passionate in his iterations. And she could
only shake her head, elated, yet with secret
misgiving. He had very queer ideas, mamma
had said. Was this obsession by the thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of beauty perhaps one of them? But there
was worse to follow.</p>

<p>‘Harry, are you determined to give me up?’</p>

<p>She replied miserably: ‘I can’t go against
mamma. You wouldn’t have me go against
mamma. Oh, Geoff, I would do anything else
for you.’</p>

<p>The words were like a match dropped in
dry stubble. ‘Then you do love me? You
do! You do!’</p>

<p>His violence frightened and braced her.
‘You know I like you tremendously,’ she said,
grappling with the unknown, ‘better than
anyone else in the world.’</p>

<p>‘Except your mother,’ he retorted bitterly,
and then added in a changed tone: ‘Harry
darling, we’ve never kissed. Do you like me
enough for that? We may never have another
moment alone.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, you funny boy!’</p>

<p>He bent towards her, and she kissed him,
in friendly fashion, on the cheek. ‘Happy
now?’ she asked, almost merrily, hoping to
drive away his tragic air.</p>

<p>He smiled. ‘Not exactly.’ An odd smile
it was. And at the bend of the road, under
the shadow of Mrs. Lavender’s lime trees, he
took her face suddenly between his hands and
kissed her mouth. Something stirred in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
but did not awake. She could not understand
his emotion.</p>

<p>‘Harry, you said you’d do anything for me.
Did you mean it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll think me strange. Perhaps you’ll
be shocked. It’s this: let me see you. If
I’m to go away from you, as I must, let me
see you just once, as you really are. Give me
a memory to take with me.’</p>

<p>Was he indeed mad? Poor Geoff! ‘But,
dear, you can see me now.’</p>

<p>‘Your face, your clothes. Let me see <i>you</i>,
all your beauty. Venus Anadyomene....’</p>

<p>She burned with shame as something of his
meaning dawned on her ... and now, as she
stood in her bedroom re-living the scene, the
plan he had unfolded seemed both wild and
wicked. Wild and wicked, yes: yet shot
through with a flash of poetry. An illuminated
‘Thou God seest me’ gleamed at her
from one wall, and a pledge to abstain by God’s
help from all intoxicating liquors as beverages,
signed in childish caligraphy <i>Harriet Mason</i>,
accused her from another. Wild and wicked;
but in a passion of gratitude for being loved,
and for the spark kindled within her, she had
yielded her promise.</p>

<p>‘Thou God seest me.’ Blushing hotly, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
conscious of that inquisitive eye, she took down
her hair. With a miniature clatter the pins
fell from nerveless fingers on to the glass surface
of the dressing-table. Slowly she undressed;
paused a moment, shyly stroking her
slim nude body; and then with a gesture of
resolve slipped into her kimono. The eye of God
was still upon her, but she had given her word.</p>

<p>Her woolly slippers made no sound on the
oilcloth floor. She opened her door and stepped
into the passage. Opposite her was Geoff’s
door, left purposely ajar. Tremblingly, but
swiftly lest fear should make her false, she
crossed and entered. Geoff made no sound.
She stood, too ashamed to look up, pushing
his door to with a nervous backward movement
of the hand. It closed, not without noise.</p>

<p>Her lips moved, as in prayer. She lifted
her arms high, and her garment, slipping from
white shoulders, fell and clustered at her feet,
a diaphanous shimmering mass.</p>

<p>‘Lovely, lovely ... O God!’ The scarce-heard
whisper made her heart leap in exultation.
She raised her head and looked steadfastly
at her love. He sat up in bed, still as
an image of adoration, the moonlight making
visible the worship in his eyes. She stooped,
gathered up her gown, and went out into the
passage ... into the arms of Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>‘I heard a door slam,’ said Alice. ‘What’s
the matter? Why, you’ve—— That’s Geoff’s
room!’</p>

<p>Alice became pale and for a moment speechless
with anger. When she recovered her
tongue it was to use a language strange to the
ears of Harriet.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what you mean,’ cried Harriet,
starry-eyed, ‘and I don’t care. He loves me,
Alice, because I am so beautiful, beautiful.
Why didn’t you tell me I was beautiful?’</p>

<p>She pushed past Alice and locked herself
in her bedroom. Those bitter reproaches had
no sting for her. Even had she understood
them they would have been less than a feather’s
weight against the joy now born in her heart.
For her the world was made new, clean and
new. With beauty, seen hitherto through a
glass darkly, she was now face to face. She
fell asleep exhausted with happiness, and when
in the morning mamma came to her room
and sobbed, and raved, she could understand
not a word of it.</p>

<p>‘You’ve brought disgrace and shame upon
us all, you wretched child!’ And to this
Harriet, in her profound innocence, could only
answer: ‘But we love each other, mamma.
What harm have we done?’</p>

<p>‘You shall leave my house as soon as that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
man can be made to marry you, and never
come back again.’</p>

<p>‘Am I to marry Geoff after all, then,
mamma?’</p>

<p>Yes, it appeared that she was, and that her
daring to ask the question was further proof
of her shamelessness. It was all very baffling.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. JOHN PARDOE was not an
imaginative man, but—if the truth
must be known—he had once been a child, and
though, as Mr. Pardoe aged, the child grew
smaller and smaller, it was not yet squeezed
out of existence. The secret had been well
kept. Plump, rosy, and forty-five years old,
encased in patent-toe boots, doeskin spats,
sleek morning coat, striped trousering, and
silk hat—not to mention certain articles of
underwear—Mr. Pardoe oscillated daily between
his office in Cannon Street and his
pleasant home at Putney, giving no cause to
his dearest friend or his bitterest enemy to
suspect him of having a secret hoard of youth.
His waking mind was occupied exclusively by
lighterage, freight duties, marine insurance,
bus routes, time tables, foreign exchange rates,
and the criminal ineptitude of the Government
party; and his dreams, which rose only to
the bait of cheese and spring onions for supper,
reflected his general staidness of character with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
a minimum of humorous distortion. For
more than a decade he had lived within half a
mile of the house that held Swinburne, and he
was still unaware of having anything in particular
to thank God for.</p>

<p>But in his forty-sixth year, when he had
already begun to cherish some of the idiosyncrasies
proper to a much older man and to
regard with complacency his shining porcelain
pate and his fringe of greying hair, something
happened to Mr. Pardoe that was the beginning
of a spiritual revolution. The something was
named Miss Adela Simpson, and it had for
many years typed his business letters with an
enthusiasm and a generous disregard for
pedantry in spelling which would have been
hard to match in any other city office. Perhaps
it was Mr. Pardoe’s patience with these
orthographical freedoms that won Adela’s
affection, or perhaps she alone of all his acquaintances
had divined the existence of that child
in him which I have felt it my duty to mention.
Whatever the cause, she married him; and,
being herself a fluffy, golden-haired, and
sentimental creature, with an unbounded capacity
for enjoyment, she persuaded him that he
was very happy with her. Had the matter
ended there, all might have been well: Mr.
Pardoe might have lived and died decorously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
a plain man with no nonsense about him. The
youth in him might have remained bottled
and out of sight for ever, had not Adela tampered
with the cork.</p>

<p>But destiny, in the person of Mrs. Pardoe,
chose to play tricks on this excellent man.
Some eighteen months after that rational
registry wedding, the fluffy girl insisted on
giving birth to a boy. The local doctor
assisted its entry, and the local vicar declared
its name to be Timothy. I have already said
that Mr. Pardoe was not an imaginative man,
and this event was quite outside his calculations.
Being both by instinct and training a gentleman
of considerable delicacy, he was embarrassed—as
who would not be?—and quite unable to
assume, at short notice, the rôle of fond parent.
But as the weeks passed by and the red squeaking
pudding called Timothy began to shew
some traces of its humanity, began even to
bear a slight resemblance to himself, a change
more subtle but no less real occurred in the
feelings of the reluctant father. For one
thing, the preposterous littleness of the creature
attracted his notice and excited his wonder.
Sometimes when he looked at Timothy Mr.
Pardoe’s face would break into a wholly
irrational grin. Once or twice, when no
one was near, he presented his index finger to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
be enfolded in miniature hands of unparalleled
clamminess, or played the fool with his watch;
and once, once only, he blushed to find himself
making ridiculous noises, noises not
unlike those emitted habitually by the child’s
agreeable but infatuated mother.</p>

<p>The translation of Mr. Pardoe from a
serious man with business responsibilities and
a taste for party politics into a kind of domestic
pet, thinker of thoughts too deep for tears,
and lover of children—this translation might
have continued apace had not the cook suddenly,
wantonly, left to get married. Adela,
luxuriating in her new freedom, decided to
manage without a cook; but Adela’s cooking
was no more precise than her spelling. It
played havoc with Mr. Pardoe’s digestive
apparatus, and—by that transmutation of
matter into spirit which is the most disconcerting
fact in life—Mr. Pardoe’s digestive
apparatus played havoc with Mr. Pardoe’s
temper. He became angry with the world
and with the life that crawled upon its surface.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the world continued to revolve,
and life was not extinct. Timothy, in particular,
was far from extinct. For five years
he flourished, and on his fifth birthday, at an
hour well past his bedtime, he entered Mr.
Pardoe’s study and demanded to be told a story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Mr. Pardoe, interrupted in the reading of
his favourite periodical, <i>The Bondholder’s
Register</i>, was annoyed. Birthday or no birthday,
this was an outrage: the sanctuary
violated, the high priest disturbed at his
devotions. Yet, in spite of his dyspepsia,
he exhibited an admirable restraint.</p>

<p>‘No, Timothy,’ he said, holding up a
cautionary finger. ‘I shall not tell you a
story. You know I do not like to be disturbed
in the evening. You will go to bed, and at
the proper moment I shall come to kiss you
good night. But tell you a story I will not.
I see your mother’s hand in this—this act of
rebellion. If you wanted stories you could go
to your toy-cupboard, where you would find
several volumes of stories: ridiculous enough,
no doubt, but suited to your age. Although
you cannot yet read with facility you could
easily amuse yourself with the pictures. Really,
Timothy, I can’t imagine why you should
suppose that I should tell you a story, a thing
I have never done in my life.’</p>

<p>As a substitute for an applauding public meeting
of the company’s shareholders, Timothy
was not a success. He clung to his simple
thesis with the brutal tenacity of the very
young. ‘Mummy says <i>you</i> are to tell me a
story.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>The fluffy girl appeared suddenly in the
doorway. ‘Yes, John, you really might, this
once. He’s tired of my stories. And it’s
his birthday, after all, poor little thing!’</p>

<p>‘Poor little thing!’ sneered Mr. Pardoe.
This was sheer domestic tyranny: he wouldn’t
suffer it. ‘Let me tell you, Adela,’ he cried,
pointing at her accusingly with <i>The Bondholder’s
Register</i>, ‘you are spoiling the poor
little thing, as you call him. It’s eight
o’clock, an hour past his bedtime. The way
to bring a child up....’</p>

<p>But here Mr. Pardoe was interrupted, and a
valuable homily on the training of children
thereby lost to the world. The clock began
striking. Now it was one of Mr. Pardoe’s
nervous weaknesses, of which there were
many, that he could never raise his voice
above the sound of a striking clock. He
disliked clocks. He resented their unmannerly
habit of cutting his sentences in half
and making him lose the thread of his discourse.
And now he had to wait several
seconds until that clock chose to let him
proceed with what he was saying. Very well:
he resigned himself to the delay. His face was
that of a martyr too well-bred even to invoke
his God. He mentally counted the strokes:
‘One, two, three, four, five, six, seven....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>‘Why!’ cried Mr. Pardoe, ‘that clock’s
wrong. An hour slow. I’m sure it’s eight
o’clock. I set my watch this morning by
Greenwich Time....’</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The words died on his lips, which remained
open only because in his bewilderment Mr.
Pardoe forgot to close them. He seemed
to have stepped into the very heart of Spring.
The sounds and colours and the rich earthy
smell of the woods made him tingle with
delight. Never before had he breathed such
air. It was like strong wine in its effect, and
that alarmed Mr. Pardoe, who dreaded nothing
so much as to lose control of himself. For
him the light of reason was the only legitimate
light in the universe: moonlight, starlight,
sunlight—these were merely decorative. ‘No
wonder the fruit is so fine,’ he said to himself;
and he plucked one of the golden apples from a
laden branch that bowed towards him, and set
his teeth in it with a disregard of the rights of
property that was quite foreign to his principles.
All round him tall grasses waved,
and satin-skinned trees stretched out armfuls
of treasure, their leaves luminously green, their
fruit glowing like multi-coloured glass globes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Mr. Pardoe began to revise his first impression.
It could hardly be Spring with all this fruit
already ripe for eating, and in such abundance,
such astonishing variety! Apple, pear, plum,
greengage, lemon, pomegranate, quince—‘Why,
with greengages at their present price,
there’s a small fortune here!’ He wondered
whether there was a market within easy distance.
There was no sort of road within
sight: there was only a long avenue of arched
trees, in the branches of which birds sang with
laughter as well as joy in their tumultuous
music. At his feet, wherever he stepped,
flowers sprang up as if to greet him: lilies
lifted their pale faces towards him; roses red
and blue rioted in the grass; pansies eyed him
amorously. A sound that was like colour
made audible, a deep golden sound, a singing
dream, filled the forest till it brimmed over with
loveliness. In the dim glowing air shot through
by shafts of moonlight from the outer world,
great dragonflies poised themselves, lost in
trance. ‘A trifle theatrical, perhaps,’ said Mr.
Pardoe, ‘but undeniably pretty.’</p>

<p>Moving slowly on, he racked his poor brains
for a rational explanation of these phenomena.
Nature, hitherto so circumspect, was behaving
in a most unbridled way. A voice dropped
out of the sky, like a bell: ‘Greenwich Time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
my dear sir? Good stuff, isn’t it! Come
and have some.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. But I never drink between
meals.’ The reply came from Mr. Pardoe’s
lips before he could check it. This was
absurd—he of all men to have an experience
like this! Indignantly he stared in the
direction of the voice that had hailed him. A
little golden star appeared to be falling through
the sky. It lodged in the lower branches of
a tree, writhed brilliantly for a moment, and
resolved itself into a human being: a creature
about the size of a foot-rule with a round red
baby-face. It jumped to the ground and
shook lumps of starshine from the soles of its
wooden boots. ‘Excuse me, won’t you. I’ve
been shopping. A fellow gets simply smothered
with this stuff in the Milky Way.’</p>

<p>Mr. Pardoe bowed. ‘It is for me to
apologize, if you, as I surmise, are the proprietor
of this valuable piece of orchard-land. I
fear I am trespassing. I must have lost my
way. To be perfectly frank with you, I’ve
not the slightest idea how I got here; and let
me hasten to add that I’m a strictly temperate
man. I rather fancy that I’ve been made the
victim of some clownish practical joke.’</p>

<p>The midget shed a scintillating tear, which
made a circle of green light in the grass where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
it fell. From his pocket he snatched a notebook.
‘I must make a note of that,’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘Of what?’ inquired Mr. Pardoe.</p>

<p>‘That tear. I’ve got only six to last the
whole evening. I limit myself to ten a day
now. It’s bad to become a slave to pleasure.’</p>

<p>Mr. Pardoe coughed to hide his alarm and
embarrassment. ‘Yes, yes. Quite so. Did
you read your paper this morning, my dear
sir? What a disgraceful Budget again!’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ cried the midget, turning up his eyes;
‘what is there more enjoyable than a choking
sob on a cold Wednesday morning before
breakfast? And they ought not to have
taken your clothes. I can’t allow that.’</p>

<p>‘My clothes!’ Mr. Pardoe blushed from
top to toe, and that blush was the only thing
that covered his nakedness. ‘Incredible!
It had entirely escaped my notice. I really
don’t know how to apologize. I am more
ashamed than I can say. This is a disaster
that has never happened before. Whatever
am I to do?’</p>

<p>‘A happy encounter,’ chuckled the midget,
rubbing his hands together. ‘I’m a tailor by
trade. Fit you out in no time. Three yards
of gossamer spun out of lovers’-dream. The
finer the mesh the higher the price. Excuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
my speaking commercially, but business is
business, you know.’</p>

<p>For the first time Mr. Pardoe’s heart
went out to this odd creature. ‘I share your
admirable sentiments. Business <i>is</i> business.
But I deplore this rather fanciful talk about
dreams and gossamer, this—ah—second-rate
poetry, if I may call it so. But there, I’m only
a plain business man.’</p>

<p>‘Do you believe in God?’ asked the midget
surprisingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pardoe looked revolted. ‘A rather
indelicate question, is it not? However, since
you have seen fit to ask it, I will confess that
I have never found any particular need for
believing in the Person to whom you allude.’</p>

<p>The midget put out his tongue, looking
inconceivably pert. ‘I’m God,’ said he.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me,’ Mr. Pardoe replied, with
immense dignity. ‘I cannot stand here and
listen to blasphemy. I am a member of the
Church of England.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t know the name,’ said the midget.
‘If it’s an inn, take me to it, like a good
fellow.’</p>

<p>‘Before we continue this conversation,’
said Mr. Pardoe, beginning to relish the
sound of his own voice, ‘I feel it only fair
to say that I entertain the gravest suspicions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of you. I suspect you of being a figment of
my imagination, perhaps a mere dream. I
am not aware of having eaten anything calculated
to disagree with me, but that is what has
probably happened. It’s a lesson to me, which
I shall not easily forget, that one cannot be too
careful about one’s diet.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what you are talking about,’
remarked the midget. He paused to draw
three circles in the grass with the point of his
foot. ‘But if you want some Greenwich
Time you’ve come to the right place. Slip
these shoes on.’ In the centre of the middle
circle was a pair of loose-fitting shoes, rather
like goloshes, made of the skin of a green reptile.
It seemed to be covered with eyes. Mr.
Pardoe, convinced now that he was dreaming,
obediently slipped his feet into these shoes,
which immediately began to dance. He found
it impossible to control them. That didn’t
surprise him so much as did his enjoyment of
the dance. ‘Come along,’ said the midget,
kicking up his heels, and Mr. Pardoe, following
in the wake of that preposterous figment of his
imagination, danced down the avenues of
Faery with a light heart. Something was
released inside him. He felt himself shrink
till he was scarcely bigger than his guide,
and the loss of that frock coat and that pair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
nicely creased striped trousers distressed him
no longer. Was it possible that the child he
had secreted so long had at last broken out,
and that the old John Pardoe, that bond-holding,
cheque-endorsing animal, was no
more? Was it possible that he had died, and
that this was the glorious resurrection promised
to the faithful? Mr. Pardoe’s thoughts buzzed
in his brain like a hive of bees when he remembered
this little tailor-fellow’s blasphemous
claim to godhead.</p>

<p>Nothing more unlike Mr. Pardoe’s conception
of God can be imagined than the ruddy-faced
mischievous creature who stood in the
doorway of his house to welcome his guest.
The house bore a striking resemblance to a
country inn, the best kind of country inn, and
Mr. Pardoe fell instantly in love with it. The
sight of it induced in him a thirst such
as he had never in all his life experienced
before.</p>

<p>‘You’d like to see my beard, I expect,’
remarked his host, as they stepped across the
threshold. ‘Well, there it is.’ He waved a
careless hand towards the centre of the oak-raftered
room, where, in a flower-pot that stood
in the middle of the table, a grey beard
flourished.</p>

<p>Mr. Pardoe scratched his head: sure proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
that he was feeling more at home. ‘Now I
can’t quite place that,’ he said, reverting to the
idea that he was in a dream. ‘The dancing
shoes were from Hans Andersen, but this for
the moment eludes me.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a good growth,’ said the beard’s
owner. ‘Never gives any trouble. Great
advantage, not wearing it on the chin. Some
of my clients don’t care about a bearded
tailor. And to those who do, I say: Step
inside. A place for everything and everything
in its place, and the place for my beard
is the parlour. Very quiet and well-behaved,
and drinks far less water than an aspidistra.
If it sings too loud I just snip it down a bit
with me scissors.’</p>

<p>‘The Singing Beard,’ mused Mr. Pardoe.
‘That must be a public-house sign I’ve come
across somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘Now,’ urged the genial tailor, ‘what about
a little refreshment. Or would you rather I
set about that suit of clothes first?’</p>

<p>The eyes of the abandoned Pardoe sparkled.
He visioned a wineglass, the size of a milking-pail,
filled with champagne. He felt it against
his lips, felt it slip down his dry throat, and
sink into his innermost being like a benediction....
He looked at his host with a
little shamefaced smile. ‘Well, if it’s all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
same to you ... if you’ll excuse my rather
unconventional appearance....’</p>

<p>‘Come down to the cellar,’ cried his friend,
taking him by the arm, ‘the Cellar of a Thousand
Bottles.’ Still gripping Mr. Pardoe, he
stamped thirstily on the floor. A trapdoor
opened. They shot into the cellar with
lightning speed, and before he could remember
his manners Mr. Pardoe was knocking the
tops off bottles with a skill that in cooler
moments would have astounded him.</p>

<p>‘There you are!’ cried the little tailor.
‘Greenwich Time on every label. Look for
our trademark and refuse imitations.’ He
drank copious draughts. He became confidential,
even affectionate. ‘Now that’s the
difference between you and me. Your name’s
Pardoe. That just shews the difference between
you and me. Now my name’s Dionysus,’
he went on, with a radiant smile. ‘It’s a good
name. And me father’s name was Dionysus
before me. But me grandfather—ah, that’s
another story.’</p>

<p>‘And what, my little man, was your grandfather’s
name?’ enquired Mr. Pardoe, waving
his glass in air.</p>

<p>‘Oh, me grandfather? Were you asking
after me grandfather? Ah, <i>his</i> name, don’t
you see, was Dionysus. They distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
us one from the other by our trades. We
were tailors, you know, all three of us.’</p>

<p>Mr. Pardoe rose to his feet. The performance
was a credit to him. He made a
last effort to exorcise the demon of levity that
possessed him. ‘My friend, you have had
enough. More than enough. You are intoxicated.’</p>

<p>Dionysus paused in his drinking to fix a
waggish eye on Mr. Pardoe. ‘Drunk. Drunk
as a god. Aren’t you! Why the devil don’t
you drink? Imprison you for sobriety.’</p>

<p>He held a brimming glass to the lips of Mr.
Pardoe, and, as he drank, the poor bewitched
gentleman saw his host swell till the house
could no longer contain that vast bulk. Himself
a flame of exultation, Mr. Pardoe stared
until the eyes of Dionysus became fierce seas,
sparkling with unearthly light, towering in
storm, and the glory of his sunset-face filled the
sky.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>‘... eight.’ The last stroke of eight
o’clock. Mr. Pardoe, rubbing his eyes, saw
that his wife’s face still wore the expression of
bored patience with which she was accustomed
to receive his domestic sermons, and that
Timothy, as before, balanced himself on one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
leg and jerked his body backwards and forwards
by way of passing time. They seemed
to be waiting for him.</p>

<p>‘What’s this?’ cried Mr. Pardoe, staring
at the paper in his hand. He recognized <i>The
Bondholder’s Register</i>. An alarming idea
visited him. ‘Am I...?’ He looked
down at his legs, stroked his arms. Yes, he
was. He breathed deeply in his relief. ‘My
dear, did you notice anything, anything
unusual?’</p>

<p>Blank faces greeted him.</p>

<p>‘Between the seventh and eighth stroke
of the hour—did anything happen to me?’</p>

<p>His wife took a step towards him. Her
eyes became anxious. ‘No, dear. Are you
feeling ill?’</p>

<p>‘No, no. Perfectly well. Just a whim
of mine. A mere fancy. Nothing at all.
Nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, father!’ said Timothy, for the fourth
time, ‘you <i>might</i> tell me a story.’</p>

<p>Mr. Pardoe turned to the boy with enthusiasm.
He beamed paternal affection upon
him. ‘Yes, old man. Come along. A story
before we go to bed, eh?... Once upon a
time there was a tailor who lived in the forest
and kept a beard, a grey beard, which sang
pretty tunes....’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MOLE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CONVERSATION turned inevitably to the
local tragedy that was agitating all the
village. The little general store, the only shop
the place boasted and a poor thing at that,
had been burned down in the night, and nothing
remained but the heap of ruins from which,
not many hours since, two charred corpses had
been removed. Our chessmen stood in battle
array, ready for action, but unnoticed by either
of us. Something in Saunders’s manner held
my attention. Sceptic though I am, I have
always found him interesting. He pays me
the compliment of divesting himself of his
rectorship when he visits me, and it has flattered
my vanity to believe that I see a side of
him that is for ever hidden from those of his
parishioners who assemble Sunday by Sunday
to receive from him their spiritual ration. And
I was the more intrigued because I divined
depths in him still to be explored.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am over-fanciful, said Saunders,
edging his chair nearer to the fire; but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
had always seemed to me that there was more
in their marriage than the mere female domination
so obvious to every one. And when poor
Gubbins came to me last winter, with the story
that I’m going to tell you, my guess was confirmed.
Mrs. Gubbins wore the breeches—a
vulgar phrase for a vulgar thing—but that
wasn’t all. I shall never forget my first visit
to her shop. You’ve seen the woman scores
of times, but I’ll tell you the impression she
made on me. Her face was leather; her nose
was pinched and pitiless; her eyes—did you
ever notice her eyes? You’d expect her to
possess the malignant dominating eyes of the
shrew. No such thing. Mrs. Gubbins’s eyes
resembled those of a mask, or of a corpse:
they were fixed, so it seemed to me, in a cold,
everlasting, fishy scrutiny of a drab world. If
they were the windows of her soul, they were
windows made of frosted glass. Looking at
them I seemed to see vacuity behind them.
Looking again, I surmised a soul indeed, but
a damned soul. A professional prejudice, perhaps,
that you won’t sympathize with. But it
was not her eyes that most disturbed me. I
have seen a variety of unpleasant eyes. But I
have never seen on any human being so ugly a
mole as was on that woman’s chin. It was
about the size of a pea, and growing from it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
were three longish black whiskers. The thing
looked positively feline. It became for me,
as soon as I caught sight of it, her most
significant feature. And that, too, proved a
good guess.</p>

<p>I had gone to the shop ostensibly to buy a
cake of soap, but really in the hope of catching
a glimpse of a human soul, of two human souls.
I had heard queer accounts of this couple, and
I was curious.</p>

<p>‘A cake of soap, please, Mrs. Gubbins.’ I
was then a stranger to her, as to all the village,
but my use of her name evoked no sign of
life in those glassy eyes of hers. She turned
to her husband, that mild little man with
dreaming eyes and a trim beard who looked
just what he was, a lay preacher with a taste
for fantastic prophecy. He was sitting at the
back of the shop on a case of sugar, or something
of the kind, engrossed in reading his
pocket Bible.</p>

<p>‘Run along,’ said Mrs. Gubbins, in her flat
expressionless voice. ‘Soap, George! You
know where it is!’</p>

<p>The little man looked up with the air of
one dragged unwillingly from a dream. In
his small rabbit-eyes Christian patience did
battle with resentment. I seemed to scent a
crisis. Had the woman nagged him for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
idleness I couldn’t have blamed her. But
what interested me was not the rights and
wrongs of the quarrel, but its method.</p>

<p>He blinked at her defiantly. There was a
pregnant silence during which they stared at
each other. Then the woman, protruding her
chin, elongating her thin neck, bent a little
towards him. I was dumbfounded with
astonishment and a kind of morbid curiosity.
For the moment it seemed to me that she must
be mutely demanding a kiss in token of his
submission; but while I watched, fascinated
out of my good manners, she lifted her hand
slowly and placed her index finger upon the
point of her chin. It flashed on me that she
was directing his attention to that mole of
hers.</p>

<p>Gubbins averted his eyes and slid off the
seat. ‘Yes, dear!’ he muttered, and disappeared
into the bowels of the shop.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Secrets of the confessional? Yes, in a sense.
But Gubbins wouldn’t grudge you the story
now. It was during that phenomenally cold
spell in November, fifteen months ago, that
he came to me. That he came to me at all
should tell you something of his anguish of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
spirit, if you knew the man. Everybody knew
him to be a deeply religious person, of the
Bible-punching kind, but not everybody guessed
how his particular conception of reality had
eaten into his mind. He could prove to you
by an elaborate system of Scriptural cross-references
that the Day of Judgment was due
to occur in the summer of 1950; and the
geography of heaven was more familiar to him,
and more concrete, than the chairs and tables
in his own house or the streets of this village.
Two-thirds of him lived among these precise
humourless dreams of his, dreams that were
the fruit not of mystical experience but of a
laborious investigation, with rule and compass
and a table of logarithms, extended over fifteen
years. Two-thirds of him—that means he was
more than a little unbalanced. He was a
preposterous combination of arrogance and
humility: we had many a friendly argument
together, though the friendliness, I fancy, was
rather on my side. Blandly certain of being
the custodian of divine truth, he was yet pitifully
dubious about his own chance of salvation
and almost crazy in his forlorn pursuit of the
love of God. Almost, but not quite: in the
medical sense he was undoubtedly as sane as
you or I. Me and all my kind he disliked
because we receive payment for preaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Christ. That is what makes his appeal to me
so remarkable an event.</p>

<p>Well, he came to the Rectory and was
admitted by the maid, loyal to her orders to
exclude no one, but scared. I found him
standing on my study hearthrug, his face
ashen, his lean hairy hands clutching a cloth
cap as though it were his only hold on safety.
The white knuckles gleamed like polished
ivory. I saw the fear that flared in his tiny
eyes and guessed that he had come as a suppliant,
that in some way his faith in himself
was broken. And knowing of old the
obstinate strength of that faith, I shuddered.</p>

<p>‘In trouble, Mr. Gubbins?’</p>

<p>He appeared not to see my outstretched
hand. ‘I’ve had an escape from hell,’ he
squeaked. ‘It’s that damned monkey-spot,
Mr. Saunders.’</p>

<p>The mild expletive, coming from Gubbins,
astonished me no less than his statement. I
asked him to sit down and tell me all about it,
but he remained standing and his fingers
twitched so violently that presently his cap fell
to the ground unheeded. ‘It nearly got me,
sir, that monkey-spot.’ A local expression, no
doubt; but what did it mean? Gubbins
saw at last that I didn’t understand him. ‘That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
monkey-spot on her chin. My wife’s chin.
You must have seen it.’</p>

<p>Can you imagine two human beings, tied
by marriage, devoting all their emotional energy
to hating each other? Perhaps not; but that
is, as near as I can tell it to you, the truth
about the Gubbinses. Twenty years ago she
was an unremarkable woman, and he no doubt
a very ordinary youth. Mere propinquity, I
imagine, threw them at each other. He, with
little or nothing of the genuine affection that
might have excused the act, took advantage
of her, as the phrase is. Sin number one, the
first link in the chain that was to bind him,
the first grievance for her to cherish in her
ungenerous heart. They were married three
months before the birth of the child. It died
within an hour. She chose to see in this event
the punishment of the sin into which he, as
she contended, had betrayed her. From that
moment Gubbins was her thrall: not by virtue
of love, or the legal tie, but by virtue of the
hideous moral ascendancy that the woman had
been cunning enough, and pitiless enough, to
establish over him. Carefully she kept alive
the memory of his offence. It was a whip
ready to her hand. And when seeking for
distraction from his domestic misery he turned
to that intricate game of guesswork which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
for him religion, what he learned there of the
significance of sin only served to increase his
wretchedness.</p>

<p>He was evidently a man weak both in spirit
and intelligence, or he would have realized at
once that he was no more guilty than she was.
But once she had succeeded in imposing her
view upon him he could not shake it off. It
remained, to poison his self-respect. Side by
side with his conviction of unworthiness there
grew up a hatred of the woman he was supposed
to have wronged. And, being itself
sinful, this very hatred provided a further
occasion for remorse. It was a race between
loathing and repentance, and loathing won.
Never a personable woman, Mrs. Gubbins
became daily more repellent, until at last the
wretched husband found her mere presence a
discomfort, like an ill-fitting shoe or a bad smell.
In particular, he detested—as well he might—that
mole on her chin with its three feline hairs.
And she, fiendishly acute, found it all out.
She caught his sidelong glances of distaste,
and pondered them long; and that distaste
became another weapon to her hand. She
accused him of harbouring cruel thoughts;
taunted him with first robbing her of youth
and then despising her for lacking it; flung
out wild and baseless charges of infidelity. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
propitiate her he made the most fantastic concessions:
allowed her to turn him out of the
shop, and consented to do all the housework
in her stead. It became patent to the world
that she was master.</p>

<p>You’ll ask why he was fool enough to put
up with this treatment? But, given his weakness,
the explanation is credible enough. She
attacked him at his most vulnerable point, his
conscience. Religion, as he conceived it,
taught him to submit to circumstances, not to
master them. In his darkest hour he could
still kneel at his bedside and say, ‘Thy will,
not mine, be done.’ And he really believed
for a while that God’s will and Mrs. Gubbins’s
were in mystical accord, that she, in fine, was
the rod with which, for his own soul’s good,
heaven was scourging him. To aid this
grotesque delusion there was the spectacle of
her formal piety. For she was a prayerful
woman, scrupulous in her speech, and of
unquestioned honesty in her commercial transactions.</p>

<p>If only he could have cursed her and stood
by his words, she might have mended. But
he, who believed he had unravelled the ultimate
secrets of destiny, dared not pit his moral
judgment against hers. He was ever ready
to sit on the stool of repentance. A day came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
when hatred rose to a frenzy in him. He cut
short her complaints with an oath, poured out
the gall of his heart upon her. She seemed
quelled, and in his triumph he added a taunt,
banal and indeed puerile: ‘You whiskered
old cat!’ It was a fatal mistake. She stared
at him mutely for a moment, no doubt in sheer
astonishment. Then her eyes narrowed and
something like a smile twisted her lips. ‘Cat
and mouse,’ she remarked coldly. And—call
the man a fool, if you like—that reply terrified
Gubbins as nothing else could have done.</p>

<p>He had betrayed himself once more into the
hands of the enemy. He had provided her
with a new and a bitter grievance. Worst of
all, she knew his secret, knew that his loathing
centred on that monkey-spot of hers, as he
called it. From that moment I imagine her
cherishing that mole with the solicitude that
Samson, had he been a wiser man, would have
lavished upon his hair. It was the source and
the instrument of her power. So far as I
understood Gubbins, it was as much nausea
as hatred that the thing inspired in him.
His soul sickened at the sight of it. It
became a poison, a torture. All this she
knew and exulted in.... Curious that an
æsthetic sense, together with a weak stomach,
should suffice to work a man’s downfall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>And so I come back to that night of fear
the events of which drove Gubbins, twenty
hours later but still electric with terror, to the
refuge of my study.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Saunders paused to relight his pipe. One
disconcerting thing about the affair, he resumed
after a while, is that in Gubbins’s account of
his wife I can discover no human qualities at
all. I fancy he himself had begun to regard
her as an agent, not of God this time, but of
the devil. Characteristic of him to jump from
one pole to the other. And that theological
fantasia, his imagination, may have coloured
everything. That is as it may be. I can only
tell you what he told me.</p>

<p>You know how quickly some noxious weed
will overrun a flower-bed. Well, something
of the kind happened in the ill-disciplined mind
of Gubbins. He was pitifully susceptible to
suggestion. An idle fancy presented itself to
him: ‘Many a woman has been murdered
for less than that monkey-spot.’ And the
fancy became a fear which walked with him
night and day, a fear lest he should be betrayed
by sheer force of suggestion into murdering
his wife. You realize what that would mean;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
it would mean damnation for his soul, or so he
believed. The gallows had but few terrors
for him. I think he would have welcomed
death, could he have been sure of his salvation
hereafter.</p>

<p>The seed was sown. The idea took root.
And the more passionately he struggled against
it, the more persistently his imagination envisaged
the crime. At last one night, after a
hundred sleepless hours, he reached the end of
his tether.</p>

<p>He jumped noiselessly out of bed. Moonlight
flooded the room, imparting a ghastly
pallor to the face of the supine Mrs. Gubbins.
In sleep she had something of the chill dignity
of a corpse lying in state. The thin lips curled
back a little on one side of the mouth, and in
the gap gleamed a gold-crowned tooth, a tiny
yellow fang. On the point of her chin was
that at which the wretched man tried not to
look: itself not very offensive, but rendered
hideous by the three black jealously-guarded
hairs depending from it. Gubbins swears
that as he stood staring at his wife’s face those
hairs were moving to and fro like the long legs
of a spider, or the antennæ of an insect seeking
prey.</p>

<p>Having gazed long, he forced his fascinated
eyes away, and padded across the room. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
door clicked, in spite of him, as he opened it.
He experienced all the alarms of a guilty man.
Yet his intention was innocent enough: it was
even, in its grotesque fashion, comical. He
had determined to shear this female Samson
of her power by cutting off those three
hairs.</p>

<p>But when he returned to the bedside, and
stood again by the sleeping body of his wife,
he was overcome by nausea. Distaste for the
task paralysed his will. He felt as a sensitive
man would feel if he were forced to crush a
beetle with his naked finger. As an excuse
for delay he began examining the instrument
in his hand, which was a perfectly ordinary
pair of household scissors having, as all scissors
have, one sharp end and one blunted. The
sharp end interested him most. He scrutinized
its point and pressed it against the ball
of his thumb; and the thought flashed to him,
as though the devil himself had whispered it:
‘This is sharp enough—one thrust under the
left ear.’ He shuddered, recoiled from the
idea, and burned with shame and fear for having
ever had it. And, while still suffocating
with the sense of his own guiltiness, there
crept into his consciousness the nightmare
conviction that he was being watched. He
could not see his wife, his gaze being fixed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the scissors, but he knew that she had opened
her eyes.</p>

<p>Gubbins couldn’t explain to me the horror
of that moment. He merely bowed his head
on my mantelpiece and closed his eyes as if
to shut out an evil vision. For when, after
an age of immobility and silence, he forced
himself to look at the face on the bed, he saw
the cruel lips curled in a smile of final triumph;
and even the opaque eyes seemed for once to
shine. And what, for Gubbins, gave the last
turn to the screw of terror was that the woman
was not looking at him at all. Her gaze, full
of evil beatitude, was fixed on the ceiling. For
several minutes, minutes that throbbed with
his agony, she neither moved nor spoke; and
at last, very slowly, she moved a little higher
on to the pillow and, still smiling insanely,
bared her throat for him to strike. Gubbins
was convinced that she ardently desired him
to stain his soul with her blood.</p>

<p>Well, as you know, he didn’t murder her:
not that time, at any rate. He escaped, as he
said, from hell. But I think I would as soon
go to hell as have to live through those last
fifteen months of his. For now she had completed
his enslavement; now she had got his
miserable little soul between her finger and
thumb. Added to all her old grievances, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
daggers with which to stab at his conscience,
she had another and a more sensational one:
this terrible sin, this attempt upon her life.
Spiritual blackmail prolonged for twenty years.
No wonder he set fire to the place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A SENSITIVE MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sight of Elsie’s drawn face, that
pallid mask of desolation, moved Wyvern
to a self-pity that savoured exquisitely
on the tongue. To watch suffering and to
be unable to relieve it was a cruel experience.
He hardly dared to conjecture how much she
had suffered during the last few days of suspense
while he, the only man in the world for
her, had been trying to make up his mind
on a matter affecting the destinies of three
persons. He could not dislike Elsie: she
had a certain fragile winsomeness and she
was still, though her first bloom was gone,
pathetically young. Everything she said to-night
did but strengthen his conviction of her
intellectual immaturity. Between his mind
and hers there was a great gulf fixed. Now
Marion—Marion was so different. That did
not mean that he had no pity left for Elsie.
Not at all. His heart was wrung for the one
no less than for the other. That was his
tragedy: he had a threefold burden. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that point of view he had to admit himself the
most luckless of the three.</p>

<p>‘I know my little wife will understand.
Her Jim has been quite frank with her.’</p>

<p>Elsie leaned forward, chin in hands, staring
fixedly at distance. Only her extreme pallor
showed her to be suffering. For the rest,
her brow was knitted as though she concentrated
all her power upon some problem that
as yet baffled her.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Jim, I understand. I understand
that you’re so much more sensitive than other
men, and can’t resist beauty. Your gift carries
penalties with it, and acute susceptibility is
one of them. But....’</p>

<p>He glowed in appreciation of her. She
was really unique. ‘Only one woman in a
thousand could see that,’ he said warmly.
‘And my little wife is that one. She is the
dearest....’</p>

<p>Elsie winced. ‘I was going to say there’s
something I <i>can’t</i> understand. I always
thought you were the soul of honour, and you
were once. Yet you were going away from
me without a word of explanation.’</p>

<p>Sorrow looked out at her from his eloquent
brown eyes. ‘My dear Elsie, don’t disappoint
me. You’ve always been so understanding
and helpful. How many men would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
confided to their wives all that I have confided
to you about my love for Marion?’</p>

<p>‘But, Jim!’ She frowned again, struggling
to believe the best of him. ‘Jim, you didn’t
tell me anything until other people had begun
to make scandal.’ The idea hardened her.
‘I don’t believe you’d ever have told me.
You would just have gone on deceiving us
both.’</p>

<p>A gesture of impatience, and that was all.
He did not give way to anger. ‘My dear, I
realize how hard it is for you to listen to the
voice of reason in a crisis like this, but you
will try, won’t you? It all began in the most
innocent, the most human way. I was overwhelmed
by my compassion for the poor
child—virtually imprisoned, as she is, with a
husband she can’t even respect, let alone love.
And then the affection ripened. She stimulates
me wonderfully. She is an inspiration,
just the inspiration that I need. Our minds
are so beautifully attuned.’</p>

<p>And still Elsie was not satisfied. ‘You
know I don’t grudge you anything, Jim. It’s
the deceit that worries me. She ought to
know about me. You ought not to take her
under false pretences. It’s not like you,
Jim, to be content with a vulgar intrigue.’</p>

<p>‘There is nothing vulgar in love.’ He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
softened the rebuke by taking her hand, which
she instantly withdrew. ‘And nothing guilty,’
he added, with a note of sternness.</p>

<p>Her laugh was of a kind that could not but
shock him. ‘How clever you are at putting
me in the wrong!’ she remarked, when her
bitter mirth had subsided. ‘But I’m not
wrong.’ Emotion induced in her a vitality
that made him almost admire her. ‘I’m not
sticking up for Respectability or any of the
seven deadly virtues, as you call them. You
dethroned these gods for me long ago. But
there <i>is</i> something I believe in. I do believe
in honour, and I hate a liar.... You’ve
deceived her as well as me.’</p>

<p>Wyvern sighed. It was sometimes hard
to be patient with women. ‘Elsie, why do
you say things which you know to be untrue?’
His tone was still gentle.</p>

<p>‘Well, isn’t it true?’ she retorted. ‘Have
you told her about me? Have you explained
that a man so many-sided as yourself needs the
love of more than one woman? Have you
told her that the human heart is capable
of almost infinite expansion? You know you
haven’t.’</p>

<p>‘I respect you too much,’ he replied, cold
with a new dignity, ‘and I respect myself
too much ever to discuss you with another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
woman. I thought you understood me better,
Elsie.’</p>

<p>The fire in her seemed to die down. Vitality
vanished, leaving her limp and listless. She
rose, a frail slip of a girl with colourless skin
and a halo of light brown hair like a dim mist—items
so negligible compared with the lilies
and roses of Marion’s robuster person, the
flaming glory of her hair, the seductiveness
of her brimming youth. Wyvern could not
resist making a mental comparison even in
this moment. He hated himself for making
it, and he recorded it to his credit that he
hated himself. It was so like him to be
merciless to his own faults. He watched
Elsie narrowly, from behind a curtain of
cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>‘Very well, Jim. I shan’t stand in your
way; you know that. To-morrow I’ll go
away somewhere. Good night.’</p>

<p>He was pained and yet elated. She would
go away to-morrow. Fortunately she had
plenty of friends and, thank heaven, he had
long ago settled an adequate income upon her.
He had nothing to reproach himself with.
She would go away to-morrow. They would
meet again—oh, frequently. They would
always be friends. He felt more warmly
towards her than he had done for months, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
yet he was dissatisfied. The victory he had
won didn’t seem so good to him as it had
seemed in prospect. He shrank from the
suspicion that he had, in some inexplicable
way, sunk in her esteem. The idea was
unbearable.</p>

<p>‘We’ll discuss that another time. You’re
not angry, darling?’ he said. ‘You see how
inevitable it all is?’</p>

<p>With her hand on the door knob she turned
to say: ‘Yes, Jim. I’m not blaming you.’
And she went out, closing the door softly
behind her.</p>

<p>So that was all right. He smoked his
cigarette out in something like peace of mind.
Not perfect peace, however; the thought of
losing something—even something for which
he didn’t care—was distasteful. Old associations
would cling. It was an insufferable
social order that pressed this cruel alternative
on a sensitive man, ordaining that he must
release one woman before he could take another.
‘It’s all so niggardly, niggardly!’ said Wyvern,
as he stepped out into the sweetness of that
June evening. He felt the need, as he had
never felt it before, of Nature’s soothing touch,
her sunset’s balm for his eyes, the caress of her
delicate breezes on his brow.</p>

<p>For the sake of the walk he set out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
direction of his studio, a walk that would take
him away from suburban houses into little
lanes surrounded by open fields. There one
could get close to Nature and to Beauty. He
had often been grateful to his own foresight
for having provided him with a studio not
only separate from his residence but distant
from it by many miles. Only in solitude, he
murmured to himself, can the human spirit
grow to its full stature; and he knew that the
rather recondite art whereby he supplemented,
or failed to supplement, his substantial private
income could never have flourished in the
vicinity of Elsie, who was, when all was
said, ‘a dear little woman, but no artist.’ In
his studio he could work undistracted; and
once or twice, when the tide of his inspiration
had been at the full, he had stayed there for
several days, sleeping at nights upon a little
canvas folding-bed. There was something
Spartan about the practice that appealed to
him. Elsie exhibited a suitable distress at
these absences, but she encouraged his painting
and applauded the results, though without
revealing any real critical understanding of
them. James Wyvern professed allegiance to
no school, and to that fact attributed his failure
to obtain recognition. He dealt too exclusively
in subtleties to be able to please the multitude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
even the multitude of art-critics. It was his
declared purpose to demonstrate by his work
a familiar French aphorism: <i>La vérité consiste
dans les nuances.</i> ‘The Boot Cupboard’ and
an unnamed picture representing amethyst-blue
houses were perhaps his most successful productions.
‘Representation, no. Symbolism,
if you like. Representation is an artistic vice.’
Yet he had his lapses and was deliciously
conscious of them. ‘My dear, I am daring.
I am taking the gravest risk. What do you
think—a ploughed field! Positively a ploughed
field! The danger is simply colossal.’ To
his artist-friends he was in the habit of saying:
‘Fundamentally, I suppose, I’m a novelist.’
Just as, three years before, during his literary
period, he had fended off praise by murmuring:
‘I’m happiest, after all, with my palette and
brush.... Oh, that little box of paints!’</p>

<p>Striding along between fragrant hedges, he
luxuriated in the joy of the open air and in his
new sense of freedom. Everything had been
explained to Elsie, and she had taken it, on the
whole, beautifully. He was really grateful to
Elsie. And now he was a free man. ‘Freedom,
the deep breath!’ he quoted in rapture.
He was free now to rescue Marion, his imprisoned
princess, from her dungeon of despair.
He would take her away, far away. Away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
from censorious England to the magic air
and blue skies of Italy, where life should
become an exquisite indolent dream. ‘Ah
yes,’ he said. ‘Como! Como shall be the
<i>mise-en-scène</i>.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dreaming of Como, he entered the studio.</p>

<p>‘What the devil——!’ There she was,
Marion herself, in his wicker-chair. ‘My
darling, <i>you</i>!’ He was amazed to find her
there, and amazed by the unearthly beauty of
her. She rose to meet him, excited fear
shining in her large eyes.</p>

<p>‘Hullo, Jimmy! You won’t be glad to
see me.’ How the deuce did she know that?
‘John has found out about us. He made a
scene. He’s dangerous. I’ve fled the house.’</p>

<p>‘Marion, what a wonderful girl you are!
What a study in contrast—your fragrant
English girlhood, and your exotic chintz
dress!’ He enfolded her in arms of solicitude.
‘My dear, tell me it all.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all. People have been talking to
him. He threatened me. So I came here.’</p>

<p>He could see her nostrils dilate and her
breasts flutter in the intoxication of the danger.
‘Like netted fish they leap,’ he quoted to himself.
Aloud he murmured: ‘Darling, you
came here. Yes, of course. But how....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>‘Oh, I found out where it was and just
came. There was a woman here——’</p>

<p>He was startled. ‘A woman?... Oh,
Mrs. Phillips, perhaps, the woman who cleans
up.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. I told her I was a friend of your
wife’s, and she let me stay. Cheek, wasn’t
it! Invented a wife for you. Just bluff, but
it came off.... Do give me a cigarette.’</p>

<p>But this would never do. Here they were
alone together, in a most compromising situation,
while her husband—positively a dangerous
fellow—raged round the countryside looking for
her, perhaps with a pistol. At any moment——‘But,
my darling girl, is it wise?’</p>

<p>With no sign of having heard the question,
she rested her head on his shoulder. ‘Darling
Jimmy, what shall I do?’</p>

<p>It was surely the most beautiful moment of
his life. He was touched almost to tears by
her perfect trust in him. All her dewy freshness,
all her passionate beauty, all her vital
young womanhood, was his for the taking. He
had but to say: ‘Come with me now....
Como!’ and she would come. But was it
wise to act so hastily? He plunged into a
delirium of pleasurable emotion only to emerge
with that question in his mind. With his lips
clinging to hers he asked it. Was it wise?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
They would go away sooner or later: that
was inevitable; but to go now, would it not
be precipitate? To take a woman from her
husband was a serious matter, involving
unexampled responsibility. He would be
bound to her more surely than by any legal
marriage. And the scandal, the hateful publicity,
the dragging of one’s name through the
divorce courts—it was all so intolerable to a
sensitive man. He would incur the enmity
of many people, and he would lose Elsie.
Elsie would divorce him, would perhaps forget
him and re-marry....</p>

<p>He released Marion from that mad embrace.</p>

<p>‘What am I to do, darling?’ she repeated.</p>

<p>‘Let me think, dear,’ he said, stroking his
troubled brow. ‘Let me think. Above all
we must listen to the voice of reason. So
much depends on this. Don’t you think it
would be best for you to go back? Only for
a while, of course.’</p>

<p>She stared as though he had spoken in an
unknown tongue. ‘Go back? Go back to
John?’</p>

<p>‘Only for a few weeks, darling, until I can
see daylight, and make all arrangements.’</p>

<p>She stepped back from him a few paces, as
if to survey him the better. Her eyes had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the surprised and stricken look of a child
unaccountably hurt.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I understand. Are you
telling me to go back to my husband? <i>You</i>,
are you telling me <i>that</i>?’</p>

<p>‘My darling girl, don’t you see....’</p>

<p>‘Do you understand what that means? Go
back to my husband who, when I last saw
him, was raging like a beast. Go back to
him and, if he doesn’t kill me, be his woman.’</p>

<p>‘Dear heart, for a few weeks only.’</p>

<p>She trembled violently for a moment, and
then became rigid with scorn. ‘I agree with
you perfectly. I had better go.’</p>

<p>The door slammed behind her before Wyvern
recovered his wits. He ran forward a few
steps as if to pursue her ... and stopped.
‘My God, I shall never see her again!’ He
buried his face in his hands. ‘Perfect harmony,
complete understanding, all lost. That
was the moment, the moment of my life, and
I let it pass. Como ... I shall never bear
to look on Como again.’ Painful as his
sensations were, they were undeniably interesting.
If ever he wrote a novel he would make
that incident the pivot of the plot, the crisis,
the turning-point. ‘There is a tide in the
affairs of men.... By Jove there is!’ Why
had he not taken it at the flood? It was all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
too sudden—no arrangements made, and a
picture half-finished. Marion—he must forget
Marion. Perhaps he had been mistaken in
her. Her scorn for him had been so undeserved;
he writhed at the recollection of
it. He yearned now for some haven of refuge.
Bruised and broken by life, his heart cried out
for comfort. Ah, Elsie—she did not scorn
him. A stab of fear lest the impossible had
happened, lest he had alienated his wife’s love,
sent him flying out of the studio and on the
road for home. Forsaken by both women, he
would be homeless indeed, and with no balm
for his wounds. What if it were his fate to
be misunderstood again? He began rehearsing
the speeches he would make to Elsie. He
conjured up the scene: Elsie in her night-dress,
sitting up in the rumpled bed, just disturbed
out of sleep. Perhaps she would be a
little cruel at first: women were like that.
‘If my little wife is not kind to me now I
shall go mad with the pain of it all.’ At that
she would relent, and weep upon his breast.
And she would love him more dearly than ever
for having been so near to losing him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NEEDING some stakes for my new fruit
trees, I called on Saunders, who knows
everything, to ask him where they could be
obtained. Saunders is something more than
a rector: he is a shepherd of souls. He has
an extraordinary capacity for listening, and
listening, he tells me (without any irony), is
the most important of his duties—far more
important than preaching church doctrine Sunday
by Sunday. This is fortunate, for in my
belief Saunders’s orthodoxy would not survive
a very minute scrutiny. The villagers go to
him with their most secret troubles, their
most lurid sins, and come away with hearts
eased, comforted by a platitude or two or by
wordless sympathy. His mind must be quite
a filing-cabinet of what are called human
documents. With so much silent listening to
do, perhaps he finds me as useful as I find him
interesting; for I am always willing, when
he is with me, to keep my ears open and my
mouth shut. He is a good talker but not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
garrulous one: it is the things he leaves unsaid,
or half-unsaid, that interest me most in his
discourse.</p>

<p>As I had expected, he put me at once in the
way of getting my stakes. ‘Bowers, of Yew
Tree Farm, is the best man. He’s a good
fellow, Bowers. For your own soul’s sake
you’ll have to keep an eye on his charges:
they’re generally much too low. Yew Tree
Farm—you know the place? It’s not really a
farm at all: it’s a ramshackle wooden house
standing by the side of a timber-yard. Near
poor Miss Lettice’s cottage.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you call her poor?’ I asked.
For Saunders was not in the habit of using that
epithet without cause.</p>

<p>‘Ah, haven’t you heard? She has been
taken away, you know. You spend too much
time among those books of yours, my friend.
Why, it happened over a week ago. Pitiful
affair. She lapsed suddenly into a kind of
grotesque babyhood.’</p>

<p>I can never hear of such an event without
shuddering. ‘But she wasn’t an aged woman!’
Already one spoke of her in the past tense
as of the dead.</p>

<p>‘She was fifty-eight,’ said Saunders; and
though genuinely shocked by the disaster I
couldn’t help being amused for a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
by the exactness of his information—it was so
characteristic of him that he knew the woman’s
age to a year. ‘No,’ he added, ‘it wasn’t the
sort of thing that should happen in the ordinary
course of nature.’</p>

<p>‘She had some shock,’ I suggested.</p>

<p>Saunders nodded. ‘The most cruel shock.’</p>

<p>‘And you no doubt were in her confidence,’
I insinuated.</p>

<p>Observing the curiosity that I tried politely
to dissemble, he looked at me for one silent
moment and smiled. ‘There’s no reason why
you shouldn’t know. You’re a discreet fellow,
and if you weren’t such a misguided heretic I
could find it in my heart to like you. Well,
the cause of Miss Lettice’s collapse was a
psychological phenomenon that has a very old-fashioned
name.’</p>

<p>I waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>‘A broken heart,’ said Saunders. ‘Miss
Lettice is the victim of a hopeless passion.’</p>

<p>‘A hopeless passion,’ I protested, ‘at fifty-eight!’</p>

<p>Saunders drew his left hand from his jacket
pocket and with it a pouchful of tobacco, which
he tossed into my lap. ‘You’re not in a hurry
for ten minutes?’</p>

<p>I am never in a hurry when Saunders settles
down into his chair with that air of pensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
reminiscence; so, when we had both got our
pipes going, he told me the story.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>You are surprised (said Saunders) at being
asked to associate Miss Lettice with the idea
of passion, requited or unrequited. And, if
you recall her small plump figure, and the nun-like
pallor of the face that peered placidly
from under her black bonnet, you will readily
believe that hers was no ordinary passion. But
it was passion: let there be no mistake about
that; I’m not going to fob off some remote
mystical ecstasy upon you under that name.
It’s hard enough to credit that the heart of that
staid, quaint, curtseying old spinster was
aflame with a hunger that ultimately destroyed
her, but the evidence is overwhelming. It is
twofold, that evidence: there is the evidence
of her words and the evidence of my own eyes.</p>

<p>My interest in Miss Lettice was first roused
by a disquieting rumour that reached me, by a
devious route, from a neighbour’s wife who
was employed by Miss Lettice to come in and
do the rough housework for her. According
to this rumour Miss Lettice was, for no stated
reason, afraid of me. This puzzled me, as
well it might, because at that time I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
even know who she was: if we had met in the
street I could not have recognized her. But it
was more than puzzling: it was distressing.
I knew that if I were to be of any use to the
parish at all, fear was the very last emotion
I must inspire. I examined the few sermons
I had preached, for there, I thought, since they
were the only communications I had had with
the lady, the solution of my problem must lie.
I looked for unsound doctrine, or for traces of
hell-fire, or for anything else that could have
alarmed a timid soul; and I found nothing.
You must remember that I was new to the
job, and totally without experience, and altogether
too disposed to take trifles seriously.
To-day I should soon find a summary
method of dealing with such a situation, but
at that time it baffled me. I accepted it for
a while as a permanent minor discomfort.</p>

<p>I had promised myself to make friends, if I
could, with every member of my congregation,
and with as many others as I could contrive
to visit—no small undertaking in this wilderness
of scattered dwellings. Miss Lettice
had to wait her turn, of course, but it was a
point of honour with me that she should not
have to wait beyond it. Nervous, but also
curious, I knocked at her front door.</p>

<p>She received me, rather sternly, I thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
but without discomposure. I was shewn into
a tiny mottled room, which she called, I
believe, the parlour. It was rather crowded by
furniture, but the furniture itself was good and
old and the mantelpiece was laden with less
than the usual cottage assortment of bric-à-brac,
though, of course, there was the inevitable
lustreware glittering on each side of a marble
clock, and, equally inevitable, a pair of china
dogs. The pink beflowered walls were hung
with very bad pictures, in the Marcus Stone
tradition, most of them from Christmas annuals;
but there was not a photograph to be seen
anywhere. I remembered having heard Miss
Lettice described as ‘a real lady in reduced
circumstances,’ and I knew that she supplemented
a tiny inherited income by giving music
lessons.</p>

<p>For half an hour we talked of indifferent
things, and I began to fear that I should never
succeed in breaking through her armour of
frigid politeness. But in those days I was an
obstinate young mule and determined to get
at the truth behind that rumour. At last
she gave me my chance.</p>

<p>‘You have been in the parish three months,
have you not, Mr. Saunders?’</p>

<p>I chose to regard the remark as a challenge.
‘Three very busy months,’ I answered, loading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
my words with all the weight they would
carry.</p>

<p>‘Too busy, I’m sure, to visit middle-aged
nobodies,’ she retorted. And then, taking
sudden pity on my youthful confusion—I
was nearly twenty years her junior—she
smiled in a way that seemed to betoken forgiveness.</p>

<p>It was a smile almost maternal, and it
emboldened me. ‘Miss Lettice,’ I said,
smiling in return, ‘why do you dislike me?’
Placidly she shook her head. ‘Then why <i>did</i>
you dislike me? Oh, never mind how I
know. Things soon get about in a little
community like ours.’</p>

<p>She seemed startled. ‘What do you know?’
Her eyes narrowed to gimlet points. The
abrupt change in her manner disconcerted me.
‘What do you know?’ she repeated defiantly,
and, finding me silent, she flung another
question at me, this time a veritable challenge:
‘Do you know about my son?’</p>

<p>Her son! So that was the cause of all
the misunderstanding. ‘Nothing at all,’ I
assured her. ‘Upon my word this is the
first I’ve heard of him. Did you think....’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I did. I thought you disapproved
of me, as your predecessor did, or maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
his wife. I thought you were never going to
call.’</p>

<p>‘But why,’ I protested, ‘why should I or
anyone presume to disapprove of you?’ And
I wondered what travesty of religion had been
current in this parish before my coming.</p>

<p>She looked unaccountably severe. ‘I think
you don’t understand.’</p>

<p>‘I think I do,’ said I, with cheerful arrogance.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Saunders, I am an unmarried woman,
and I have a son.’</p>

<p>‘Yes?’ I said, simulating polite interest
when in truth I was burning with curiosity.
But if I hoped to win her sympathy by this
unconventional attitude I was to be woefully
disappointed. ‘You don’t seem to realize
the gravity of what I tell you,’ Miss Lettice
rebuked me. ‘It is mistaken kindness to
treat a sin so lightly.’</p>

<p>‘I want to be a friend to the parish, not a
judge.’ Priggish remarks rise readily to the
lips of a young man such as I was then. ‘Besides,’
I added, ‘if your son was a child of
true love there was no worse a sin than indiscretion.’</p>

<p>But the confessed sinner would not hear of
such wickedness. ‘You, the vicar, to say a
thing like that! That’s not the kind of
teaching we want in this parish. Why, I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
done penance all my life for that indiscretion,
as you dare to call it. I forfeited marriage
and sent my lover away. Not even for the
child’s sake would I condone our sin by
marrying. And do you tell me that all my
bitter repentance was unnecessary?’</p>

<p>What could I say? It would have been
cruel to convince her that she had thrown
away her happiness in sheer waste, sacrificed
her life on the altar of a false god. I hadn’t
the heart to attempt it, so I fell back, I’m afraid,
on Scriptural quotations, and left it at that.
The familiar words seemed to comfort her and
to reinstate me in her eyes as a moralist. None
the less she was sufficiently assured of my
sympathy to speak of her love, and as she
spoke I began to wonder whether after all my
pity had not been misplaced. Sin or no sin,
the memory of her golden youth was dear to
her. She was repentant enough, no doubt,
when she remembered to be; but she did not
live by morality alone. The woman in her
still exulted, the woman’s eyes still shone,
in the knowledge that she had, however long
ago, been found beautiful. ‘We were very
young,’ she said, with disarming simplicity,
‘and we loved each other very much. He was
all the world to me.’ Her cheeks flushed;
her meagre bosom rose and fell tremulously—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> 
in that moment I saw her as she had been,
young, fresh, adorable, alight with limitless
ecstasy, the incarnation of a man’s desire. The
transfigurement endured only for a flash, and
flickered away, leaving me desolated with the
stabbing poignancy of life. From that to this,
I thought, we must all pass. To hide my
emotion I led the talk back to her son. ‘And
where is he now?’ I asked. ‘Does he often
come to see you?’</p>

<p>She smiled wanly. ‘He’s all I’ve got.
You see there’s a place set for him. You’ll
take a cup of tea with us?’</p>

<p>The lid of the kettle that stood on the fire
was already palpitating. Miss Lettice made
the tea and enclosed the pot in a knitted cosy
of green wool. For the next few minutes we
exchanged only tea-table talk. But afterwards,
when I made gestures of going, she
confronted me wistfully, her eyes lit up once
again. But this was a new light, and one
more consonant with her years.</p>

<p>‘Would you like to see his room?’ she said,
almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>I expressed eagerness, and she led me to the
threshold of a room so tiny that it made one
think of a monastic cell. It was just large
enough to contain a small single bed, ready for
use, a wash-stand, and a miniature dressing-table.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> 
The furniture was all of childish
dimensions. In the further corner, under the
window, stood a cricket-bat. I glanced round
with the vague smile of politeness. ‘So this
is Bernard’s room. A snug little place.
And I see it’s all ready for his return.’</p>

<p>After a silence Miss Lettice sighed. ‘He
would have been eighteen this coming April,’
she murmured.</p>

<p>I stared at her a moment in stupid wonder.
‘He would have been ... do you mean...?’</p>

<p>‘He was stillborn,’ she confessed, and her
glance dropped before my stare. ‘It was
silly not to tell you at once. But Bernard’s
all I’ve got. He’d be a fine big fellow by now.’</p>

<p>To avoid those glistening eyes I turned
away, only to encounter a sight but one degree
less pitiful: Bernard’s cricket-bat—symbol of
lusty young manhood, white flannels, sunlit
turf—which no cricketer’s hand had ever
grasped. What could I say or do? I was
angered as well as touched by the wanton
sentimentality of that room, and having murmured
words of conventional comfort I hurried
back to the vicarage. Not until many hours
had passed did I succeed in hustling away my
mood of melancholy; and as I entered my own
bachelor bedroom I shuddered to hear, in
imagination, the Good-night uttered by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
fond impossible woman to the ghost with
whom she shared her home.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Saunders got out of his chair, as though the
story were finished, and stood with his back
to the fire warming the palms of his hands.
There was a moment’s silence, which I saw no
reason for breaking, and then he began talking
again. After that, he said, Miss Lettice and
I were quite good friends. I became a constant
and welcome visitor at her cottage: constant
because her solitude was something of a pain
to me, and welcome because she knew that to
me she could talk about Bernard to her heart’s
content. And that, by Jove, was a privilege
she lost no opportunity of exercising. How
many times have I piously lied to that woman
assuring her that my interest in her Bernard
was insatiable! Often, as you’ll readily understand,
I was bored beyond expression, though
I never lost my sense of the grotesque pathos of
her life. But I must be careful not to let you
suppose that she was a mere monomaniac.
She knew, as well as I did, that she was playing
a game of make-believe: she was not the
victim of any sort of delusion, and her obsession
never became pathological or threatened to
become so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Things went on like this for ten years or so.
She lived untroubled among her dreams until
some few months ago. During the war
Bernard led an existence even more shadowy
than usual. Of course he enlisted, and was
wounded, and won decorations for his valour;
and Miss Lettice, knitting socks for more
substantial soldiers, continued to play her
secret game by fancying that they would comfort
the feet of her son. The change came, as
I’ve said, not many months ago, and it shewed
itself first of all in our conversations. From
those conversations Bernard was painlessly
excluded, and his place taken by a young man
weighing twelve stone or more. You’ll know
the name well enough—Jack Turnbull, the
stationmaster’s son. Jack began to loom so
large in the hopes and fears of Miss Lettice
that I became uneasy, the more so because
I had been the instrument of bringing them
together. It was this way. During the latter
part of the war, and ever since, Miss Lettice
had found it increasingly difficult to manage
on her extremely modest income, and music
pupils were more in request than ever. I
did what I could for her by dropping a recommendation
here and there, and among others
I enlisted the active sympathy of old Turnbull.
Together we hatched a little conspiracy, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
upshot of which was that Jack, a big hulking
fellow approaching thirty years, was fired with
a sudden ambition to become an amateur
pianist. Jack had done well in the army,
and finding himself in mufti again, at a loose
end, and with a captain’s gratuity standing to
his credit at Cox’s, he lent himself very readily
to the amiable fraud. His three hours tuition
a week was very useful to Miss Lettice; but
it proved her undoing. For now we come
to the hopeless passion I spoke of. And I
needn’t stop to assure you that there’s nothing
scandalous in this tragic affair. Miss Lettice
fell in love with Jack, but the love she yearned
to lavish on him was maternal love. If you
think me perverse in calling that love a hopeless
passion I must disagree with you. It was
passion, and it was, in part, physical passion,
as all human love must be. Why do we shrink
from admitting that maternal love is as deeply
rooted in the body as any other? Miss Lettice
loved Jack Turnbull for his strength, his
masculinity, his youth, and because, by a fatal
coincidence, he was born in the same month
of the same year as her Bernard. In a sense it
was the calendar that killed the Miss Lettice
we knew and set in her stead a witless child.
No doubt Jack seemed to her a gift from
God, a wonderful consolation prize, a token<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of the heavenly forgiveness. Indeed she told
me as much when, with the air of imparting
to me her dearest secret, she said that Jack
was coming to lodge with her. She had
bought some pretty things for his bedroom,
worked ornamental bolster-slips with her own
fingers, and replaced the dressing-table by a
chest of drawers dragged in from her own
room. I hardly dared to hint my misgiving.
‘Are you quite sure he is coming?’ I ventured.
‘I fancied he would soon be looking out for a
job. Young men can’t remain idle for long
nowadays, you know.’ But she wouldn’t hear
of my doubts. Jack would get work at the
station under his father. He hadn’t exactly
promised to come to her, but she had urged
it and she knew he would humour an old
woman.</p>

<p>I was by no means so sure, and I made up
my mind to tackle Master Jack at the earliest
possible moment. I called at his father’s
house and left a message asking him to make a
point, if he could, of calling at the vicarage.
He came the same evening. ‘Well, Turnbull,’
I said. ‘I hear you’re thinking of changing
your quarters?’</p>

<p>He looked as guilty and uncomfortable as
though I had surprised him with his hand in
somebody’s till. ‘Has it got round already?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Why, I’ve told no one outside the family.
Why can’t people hold their tongues!’</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry if
I’ve annoyed you. But I really don’t see why
you should be so secretive about it. And it
wasn’t your father who told me.’</p>

<p>‘Who was it?’ He spoke curtly. Four
years as an infantry officer hadn’t improved his
manners.</p>

<p>‘It was Miss Lettice herself.’</p>

<p>I have never seen a man more astonished.
‘Miss Lettice! Miss Lettice told you!
Damn it, sir, she doesn’t know!’ After a
moment’s stupefied silence he added, with an
air of apology, ‘But perhaps we’re at cross-purposes.
What was it that Miss Lettice
told you?’</p>

<p>‘Only that you’re going to lodge in her
house. Nothing to get excited about.’</p>

<p>He began striding about the room. ‘We
are certainly at cross-purposes all right. I
thought you meant Canada. I’m leaving next
week for Canada.’</p>

<p>‘For a holiday?’ I ineptly inquired.</p>

<p>‘For keeps,’ said Jack. ‘Mounted Police,
with a commission soon, I hope. This country’s
gone to the dogs, sir.’</p>

<p>Here was a pretty mess! ‘But look here,
Turnbull, Miss Lettice has got it into her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
that you’re going there as a lodger. Have
you given her any cause to believe such stuff?’</p>

<p>At that the swagger dropped off him.
‘That woman, I’m sorry for her, but she gets
on my nerves. She gushes too much for my
taste. She wants to mother me, if you ever
heard such rot. And I won’t be mothered.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all very well,’ I cut in. ‘But why
say this to me? Miss Lettice is the person
you should complain to. Are you content
to let her go on living in a fool’s paradise?’</p>

<p>Well, you can pretty well guess how the
conversation proceeded. We argued for the
best part of three hours. Jack was determined
not to yield to her devouring maternal affection,
but he hadn’t pluck enough to tell her so outright.
He preferred to save his own feelings
by equivocation. The coward does it with a
kiss, you know, the brave man with the
sword. But I must do him the justice to
admit that, short of brutal explicitness, he did
all he could to disabuse her mind of its fond
fiction. I was aghast when I realized that the
secret of his departure was being kept solely
in order that he might slip out of the country
without bidding her good-bye. After long
battle I wrung from him a reluctant promise
that he would spare her that culminating
cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>And that is the end of the story. I too was
a coward, for I did not dare to visit Miss
Lettice until Jack had gone. In point of fact
I watched him off the premises and then stepped
in, unwillingly enough but hoping to afford
the wretched woman some comfort, if only
the comfort of distraction. The front door
yielded to my push: it was seldom locked. I
tapped at the door of the sitting-room. There
was no sound from within. Gently I turned
the handle and looked in.</p>

<p>‘Good morning, Miss Lettice,’ I said, with
a cheerfulness that was idiotic, I dare say, but
what was one to do?</p>

<p>Miss Lettice sat staring at the wall in front
of her, staring fixedly, motionless. Whether
she heard my voice or not I don’t know, but
she neither moved nor spoke. I became
very anxious and called to her again, offering
such dry crumbs of comfort as came to hand.
‘Don’t grieve, my dear Miss Lettice. There’s
still Bernard left to you.’ Something of that
sort I said to her, but it made no difference at
all. She was struck down, struck worse than
dead, by the colossal and cruel power of love.
And while I continued to stare at her with
pity and horror, she slowly turned towards
me, as though on a swivel, a face marred out of
recognition by a smile....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Saunders winced. His lips had hesitated
in releasing those last words. Lifting one
hand to his eyes, he turned away from me
towards his bookshelves. There, with a book
in his hand, he shrugged his shoulders as if to
shake off the grip of a memory.</p>

<p>‘If it’s standard trees you’re having,’ he
remarked, ‘you’ll want light six-feet stakes.
Bowers is your man.’</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WEDDING-DAY. It was curiously unreal.
His own face grimaced back at
him as he struggled to adjust his tie, a face that
no man could feel satisfied with. ‘I sometimes
wish Uncle Edgar hadn’t died after all,’ he
confided to the looking-glass. Round and
pink, with a wisp of light brown moustache
that didn’t seem to belong to it, that ghost of
himself continued to agonize. Funny, what
women could see to admire in men. As for
Florrie’s devotion to himself, the unreasonableness
of it, the obstinacy, positively vexed him.
If it hadn’t been for that little legacy they would
have had to wait another five years. Not that
he wanted to wait, but still—five years was
five years, time to turn round in. That fifty
pounds a year had made just the difference;
it had brought this day within his immediate
reach; his heart’s desire, glowing like luminous
fruit upon an inaccessible tree, had bent
suddenly towards him, and his hand was
already poised to grasp it. Fateful moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
It didn’t bear thinking about. The old man
ought not to have sprung it on him like this.</p>

<p>‘Cheer-O, Bert!’ There was a bang upon
the bedroom door, and before it could be
answered the attacking force entered tumultuously.
It was a large red-headed man, dressed
unmistakably for the approaching ceremony,
tall, clean-shaven, possessing hands a size too
big for his body.</p>

<p>‘Hullo, elephant!’ He resented the fellow’s
entry, and yet in some vague way he was
glad of it. He wanted to be alone with his
dreams, but he feared to be alone with his
doubts. Well, in a few hours solitude would
be a thing of the past indeed. Florrie and he
would be together, sleeping and waking, in
sickness and in health, till death them did
part. Forty years, perhaps, and never alone.
Breakfast with Florrie, the eight-thirteen to
town, the six-five back, a late tea with Florrie,
conversation with Florrie, supper with Florrie;
and week-ends spent going to church or digging
in the garden. There was no escape now.
Escape! Who wanted to escape? Not he,
anyhow. And that was fortunate, for here
was Maurice, the jubilant best man, and
Florrie’s brother to boot. No escape.</p>

<p>‘You’d better pull your socks up, old
feller,’ said Maurice, his face bisected by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
grin. ‘You haven’t got as much time to
spare as you seem to think. Cab’s at the
door.’</p>

<p>It was fortunate, he knew, that the tide of
events was sweeping him along, or he would have
stood for ever staring at himself in a dream
of indecision. Yet he hated to be bustled.
He was still a free man, and there leapt to life
in him a spark of anger against the man who
sought to wrest that freedom from his grasp
before the hour had struck. It would strike
soon enough, but until then ... it seemed
suddenly necessary that he should assert his
independence of Maurice. His toilet was
already completed, but he would delay a while
yet.</p>

<p>‘All right. I won’t keep you a minute.’
He spoke with an affected coolness, as though
addressing an importunate commercial traveller.
And, without haste, he picked up from
the dressing-table a small pair of nail-scissors.
With these he began cutting off his
moustache.</p>

<p>‘Hullo, what’s the game?’ asked Maurice.</p>

<p>‘Time that thing came off,’ replied Bert,
still plying the scissors. ‘Pour me out a spot
of water for shaving, there’s a good chap...
No, cold’ll do.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The world without was ablaze with summer,
a beacon in the grey waste of infinity, a fire-ball
flung into the darkness. The sky flamed
beauty down upon the responsive pavements.
But he, stubbornly, remained shut in his cold
introspection. It was as if he alone of all
created things was able to resist the infection
of gladness that the warm air held. Forty
years, forty years. The dailyness of life
terrified him. The amiable Maurice became
for him the symbol of all-conquering circumstance.</p>

<p>It was a new Florrie who joined him at the
altar, a Florrie veiled, mysterious, and therefore
seductive. ‘Therefore’ was the word stressed
by the devil in his brain. But she was undeniably
pretty, and so fragile, so like a piece of
exquisite china, that he held his breath in awe
when she yielded her hand to his. This was
the lovely ingenuous child that life, day by
day, year by year, would bend and break, and
finally cast aside. His was to be the dubious
privilege of watching that process, of watching
the hair go grey, the face wrinkle, the child-dreams
die one by one. His heart beat with
a profound pity. Poor little devil, they were
both in the same boat. She too was swearing
her freedom away, taking the veil of everlasting
monotony. And, irrationally, he blamed not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
himself, not her, but the officiating clergyman,
the guests, and most of all that fellow Maurice.
He was glad that he had not allowed himself
to be bustled by Maurice, glad to feel that
soreness of the upper lip which bore witness to
his not having been bustled.</p>

<p>The clergyman at whose feet he knelt was
tactfully gabbling words about the procreation
of children. Someone in the pews behind
was sniffing tearfully. That would be Florrie’s
mother, no doubt, that angular female version
of Maurice. He became almost bemused by
the drowsy noises, like bees in a bottle, emitted
by the priest. The sunlight, pouring through
the stained-glass window, cast a luminous
many-coloured pattern across the chancel floor.
The colours entered him—his eyes, his nostrils,
his very veins—and made his blood tingle in
tune with their brightness. A faint purple, like
wine stains; a rich yellow, like harvested corn—they
rang their little bell-melodies in his
consciousness till he lost count of time.</p>

<p>‘And I hope you’ll be very happy. Now
we’ll go to the vestry.’</p>

<p>With Florrie clinging to his arm he went
to the vestry; and there a swarm of relations,
like honey-seeking bees, descended upon them.
‘Florrie, you look too sweet!’ ‘Bert, you dear
old thing!’ And so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Florrie’s younger brother approached, fresh
from school. ‘Gratters, old horse. She’s a
good girl. I’ve trained her well. But what’s
happened to the cricket teams?’</p>

<p>‘The what?’</p>

<p>‘Cricket teams. Eleven a side, you know.’</p>

<p>Florrie translated. ‘He means your moustache,
Bert. Why did you shave it off? I
wish you hadn’t.’</p>

<p>He experienced a pang of compunction.
Curse it, why had he shaved it off? ‘Oh, I
don’t know. Thought I’d feel freer without
it.’</p>

<p>Maurice, the omnipotent Maurice, bore
down on them. ‘Off we go!’ he said briskly.
Why was he always in such a devil of a hurry?
Bert and his bride began marching down
the aisle. He wanted to dance: not with
joy, but because it was so difficult to walk
against the tempo of Mendelssohn’s Wedding
March.</p>

<p>Outside, the world still blazed. And a
hundred eyes stared. He handed Florrie
into the waiting cab, and leaped in after her,
with grains of rice trickling down his back.
Maurice, the gaoler, shut the door behind
them, and then, with incredible agility, thrust
his head through the open window-space,
elongated his neck, and kissed his sister on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the cheek. ‘Best of luck, both.’ He withdrew.
The taxi moved on, gobbling like a
turkey. ‘I’m glad I had that shave,’ said
Bert viciously. The forty years began.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DEARTH’S FARM</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is really not far: our fast train does it in
eighty minutes. But so sequestered is the
little valley in which I have made my solitary
home that I never go to town without the
delicious sensation of poising my hand over a
lucky-bag full of old memories. In the train
I amuse myself by summoning up some of
those ghosts of the past, a past not distant but
sufficiently remote in atmosphere from my
present to be invested with a certain sentimental
glamour. ‘Perhaps I shall meet you—or
you.’ But never yet have I succeeded in
guessing what London held up her sleeve for
me. She has that happiest of tricks—without
which paradise will be dull indeed—the
trick of surprise. In London, if in no other
place, it is the unexpected that happens. For
me Fleet Street is the scene <i>par excellence</i> of
these adventurous encounters, and it was in
Fleet Street, three months ago, that I ran across
Bailey, of Queens’, whom I hadn’t seen for
five years. Bailey is not his name, nor Queens’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
his college, but these names will serve to reveal
what is germane to my purpose and to conceal
the rest.</p>

<p>His recognition of me was instant; mine
of him more slow. He told me his name
twice; we stared at each other, and I struggled
to disguise the blankness of my memory.
The situation became awkward. I was the
more embarrassed because I feared lest he
should too odiously misinterpret my non-recognition
of him, for the man was shabby
and unshaven enough to be suspicious of an
intentional slight. Bailey, Bailey ... now
who the devil was Bailey? And then, when
he had already made a gesture of moving on,
memory stirred to activity.</p>

<p>‘Of course, I remember. Bailey. Theosophy.
You used to talk to me about theosophy,
didn’t you? I remember perfectly now.’ I
glanced at my watch. ‘If you’re not busy let’s
go and have tea somewhere.’</p>

<p>He smiled, with a hint of irony in his eyes,
as he answered: ‘I’m not busy.’ I received
the uncomfortable impression that he was
hungry and with no ordinary hunger, and the
idea kept me silent, like an awkward school-boy,
while we walked together to a tea-shop
that I knew.</p>

<p>Seated on opposite sides of the tea-table we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
took stock of each other. He was thin, and his
hair greying; his complexion had a soiled
unhealthy appearance; the cheeks had sunk
in a little, throwing into prominence the high
cheekbones above which his sensitive eyes
glittered with a new light, a light not of
heaven. Compared with the Bailey I now
remembered so well, a rather sleek young
man with an almost feline love of luxury
blossoming like a tropical plant in the exotic
atmosphere of his Cambridge rooms, compared
with that man this was but a pale wraith.
In those days he had been a flaming personality,
suited well—too well, for my plain taste—to
the highly-coloured orientalism that he affected
in his mural decorations. And co-existent in
him with this lust for soft cushions and chromatic
orgies, which repelled me, there was an
imagination that attracted me: an imagination
delighting in highly-coloured metaphysical
theories of the universe. These theories,
which were as fantastic as <i>The Arabian Nights</i>
and perhaps as unreal, proved his academic
undoing: he came down badly in his Tripos,
and had to leave without a degree. Many a
man has done that and yet prospered, but
Bailey, it was apparent, hadn’t prospered. I
made the conventional inquiries, adding, ‘It
must be six or seven years since we met last.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>‘More than that,’ said Bailey morosely,
and lapsed into silence. ‘Look here,’ he burst
out suddenly, ‘I’m going to behave like a
cad. I’m going to ask you to lend me a
pound note. And don’t expect it back in a
hurry.’</p>

<p>We both winced a little as the note changed
hands. ‘You’ve had bad luck,’ I remarked,
without, I hope, a hint of pity in my voice.
‘What’s wrong?’</p>

<p>He eyed me over the rim of his teacup.
‘I look a lot older to you, I expect?’</p>

<p>‘You don’t look very fit,’ I conceded.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t.’ His cup came down with a
nervous slam upon the saucer. ‘Going grey,
too, aren’t I?’ I was forced to nod agreement.
‘Yet, do you know, a month ago there wasn’t
a grey hair in my head. You write stories,
don’t you? I saw your name somewhere. I
wonder if you could write my story. You may
get your money back after all.... By God,
that would be funny, wouldn’t it!’</p>

<p>I couldn’t see the joke, but I was curious
about his story. And after we had lit our
cigarettes he told it to me, to the accompaniment
of a driving storm of rain that tapped like a
thousand idiot fingers upon the plate-glass
windows of the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago, said Bailey, I was staying
at the house of a cousin of mine. I never
liked the woman, but I wanted free board
and lodging, and hunger soon blunts the edge
of one’s delicacy. She’s at least ten years my
senior, and all I could remember of her was
that she had bullied me when I was a child
into learning to read. Ten years ago she
married a man named Dearth—James Dearth,
the resident owner of a smallish farm in Norfolk,
not far from the coast. All her relatives
opposed the marriage. Relatives always do.
If people waited for the approval of relatives
before marrying, the world would be depopulated
in a generation. This time it was
religion. My cousin’s people were primitive
and methodical in their religion, as the name
of their sect confessed; whereas Dearth
professed a universal toleration that they
thought could only be a cloak for indifference.
I have my own opinion about that, but it
doesn’t matter now. When I met the man I
forgot all about religion: I was simply repelled
by the notion of any woman marrying so odd
a being. Rather small in build, he possessed
the longest and narrowest face I have ever
seen on a man of his size. His eyes were set
exceptionally wide apart, and the nose, culminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
in large nostrils, made so slight an
angle with the rest of the face that seen in
profile it was scarcely human. Perhaps I
exaggerate a little, but I know no other way
of explaining the peculiar revulsion he inspired
in me. He met me at the station in his dog-cart,
and wheezed a greeting at me. ‘You’re
Mr. Bailey, aren’t you? I hope you’ve had
an agreeable journey. Monica will be delighted.’
This seemed friendly enough, and
my host’s conversation during that eight-mile
drive did much to make me forget my first
distaste of his person. He was evidently a
man of wide reading, and he had a habit of
polite deference that was extremely flattering,
especially to me who had had more than my
share of the other thing. I was cashiered
during the war, you know. Never mind why.
Whenever he laughed, which was not seldom,
he exhibited a mouthful of very large regular
teeth.</p>

<p>Dearth’s Farm, to give it the local name, is
a place with a personality of its own. Perhaps
every place has that. Sometimes I fancy
that the earth itself is a personality, or a
community of souls locked fast in a dream
from which at any moment they may awake,
like volcanos, into violent action. Anyhow
Dearth’s Farm struck me as being peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
personal, because I found it impossible not to
regard its climatic changes as changes of
mood. You remember my theory that chemical
action is only psychical action seen from
without? Well, I’m inclined to think in
just the same way of every manifestation of
natural energy. But you don’t want to hear
about my fancies. The farmhouse, which is
approached by a narrow winding lane from
the main road, stands high up in a kind of
shallow basin of land, a few acres ploughed but
mostly grass. The countryside has a gentle
prettiness more characteristic of the southeastern
counties. On three sides wooded hills
slope gradually to the horizon; on the fourth
side grassland rises a little for twenty yards
and then curves abruptly down. To look
through the windows that give out upon this
fourth side is to have the sensation of being
on the edge of a steep cliff, or at the end of
the world. On a still day, when the sun is
shining, the place has a languid beauty, an
afternoon atmosphere. You remember Tennyson’s
Lotus Isles, ‘in which it seemed always
afternoon’: Dearth’s Farm has something of
that flavour on a still day. But such days are
rare; the two or three I experienced shine like
jewels in the memory. Most often that
stretch of fifty or sixty acres is a gathering-ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> 
for all the bleak winds of the earth.
They seem to come simultaneously from the
land and from the sea, which is six miles
away, and they swirl round in that shallow
basin of earth, as I have called it, like maddened
devils seeking escape from a trap. When
the storms were at their worst I used to feel
as though I were perched insecurely on a
gigantic saucer held a hundred miles above the
earth. But I am not a courageous person.
Monica, my cousin, found no fault with the
winds. She had other fears, and I had not
been with her three days before she began to
confide them to me. Her overtures were as
surprising as they were unwelcome, for that
she was not a confiding person by nature I
was certain. Her manners were reserved to
the point of diffidence, and we had nothing in
common save a detestation of the family from
which we had both sprung. I suppose you
will want to know something of her looks.
She was a tall, full-figured woman, handsome
for her years, with jet black hair, a sensitive face,
and a complexion almost Southern in its dark
colouring. I love beauty and I found pleasure
in her mere presence, which did something to
lighten for me the gloom that pervaded the
house; but my pleasure was innocent enough,
and Dearth’s watchdog airs only amused me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Monica’s eyes—unfathomable pools—seemed
troubled whenever they rested on me: whether
by fear or by some other emotion I didn’t at
first know.</p>

<p>She chose her moment well, coming to
me when Dearth was out of the house,
looking after his men, and I, pleading a
headache, had refused to accompany him.
The malady was purely fictitious, but I was
bored with the fellow’s company, and sick
of being dragged at his heels like a dog for no
better reason than his too evident jealousy
afforded.</p>

<p>‘I want to ask a kindness of you,’ she said.
‘Will you promise to answer me quite frankly?’
I wondered what the deuce was coming, but I
promised, seeing no way out of it. ‘I want
you to tell me,’ she went on, ‘whether you see
anything queer about me, about my behaviour?
Do I say or do anything that seems to you odd?’</p>

<p>Her perturbation was so great that I smiled
to hide my perception of it. I answered
jocularly: ‘Nothing at all odd, my dear
Monica, except this question of yours. What
makes you ask it?’</p>

<p>But she was not to be shaken so easily out
of her fears, whatever they were. ‘And do
you find nothing strange about this household
either?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>‘Nothing strange at all,’ I assured her.
‘Your marriage is an unhappy one, but so are
thousands of others. Nothing strange about
that.’</p>

<p>‘What about him?’ she said. And her
eyes seemed to probe for an answer.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. ‘Are you asking
for my opinion of your husband? A delicate
thing to discuss.’</p>

<p>‘We’re speaking in confidence, aren’t we!’
She spoke impatiently, waving my politeness
away.</p>

<p>‘Well, since you ask, I don’t like him. I
don’t like his face: it’s a parody on mankind.
And I can’t understand why you threw yourself
away on him.’</p>

<p>She was eager to explain. ‘He wasn’t
always like this. He was a gifted man, with
brains and an imagination. He still is, for
all I know. You spoke of his face—now
how would you describe his face, in one
word?’</p>

<p>I couldn’t help being tickled by the comedy
of the situation: a man and a woman sitting
in solemn conclave seeking a word by which
to describe another man’s face, and that
man her husband. But her air of tragedy,
though I thought it ridiculous, sobered me. I
pondered her question for a while, recalling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
my mind’s eye the long narrow physiognomy
and the large teeth of Dearth.</p>

<p>At last I ventured the word I had tried to
avoid. ‘Equine,’ I suggested.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ There was a world of relief in her
voice. ‘You’ve seen it too.’</p>

<p>She told me a queer tale. Dearth, it
appears, had a love and understanding of
horses that was quite unparalleled. His wife
too had loved horses and it had once pleased
her to see her husband’s astonishing power
over the creatures, a power which he exercised
always for their good. But his benefactions
to the equine race were made at a hideous
cost to himself of which he was utterly unaware.
Monica’s theory was too fantastic even for me
to swallow, and I, as you know, have a good
stomach for fantasy. You will have already
guessed what it was. Dearth was growing,
by a process too gradual and subtle for perception,
into the likeness of the horses with
whom he had so complete sympathy. This was
Mrs. Dearth’s notion of what was happening
to her husband. And she pointed out something
significant that had escaped my notice.
She pointed out that the difference between
him and the next man was not altogether, or
even mainly, a physical difference. In effect
she said: ‘If you scrutinize the features more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
carefully, you will find them to be far less
extraordinary than you now suppose. The
poison is not in his features. It is in the
psychical atmosphere he carries about with
him: something which infects you with the
idea of horse and makes you impose that idea
on his appearance, magnifying his facial
peculiarities.’ Just now I mentioned that in
the early days of her marriage Monica had
shared this love of horses. Later, of course,
she came to detest them only one degree
less than she detested her husband. That is
saying much. Only a few months before my
visit matters had come to a crisis between the
two. Without giving any definite reason, she
had confessed, under pressure, that he was
unspeakably offensive to her; and since then
they had met only at meals and always reluctantly.
She shuddered to recall that interview,
and I shuddered to imagine it. I was
no longer surprised that she had begun to entertain
doubts of her own sanity.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t the worst. The worst was
Dandy, the white horse. I found it difficult
to understand why a white horse should alarm
her, and I began to suspect that the nervous
strain she had undergone was making her
inclined to magnify trifles. ‘It’s his favourite
horse,’ she said. ‘That’s as much as saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
that he dotes on it to a degree that is unhuman.
It never does any work. It just roams the
fields by day, and at night sleeps in the stable.’
Even this didn’t, to my mind, seem a very
terrible indictment. If the man were mad on
horses, what more natural than this petting of a
particular favourite?—a fine animal, too, as
Monica herself admitted. ‘Roams the fields,’
cried my poor cousin urgently. ‘Or did until
these last few weeks. Lately it has been kept
in its stable, day in, day out, eating its head off
and working up energy enough to kill us all.’
This sounded to me like the language of
hysteria, but I waited for what was to follow.
‘The day you came, did you notice how pale
I looked? I had had a fright. As I was
crossing the yard with a pail of separated milk
for the calves, that beast broke loose from the
stable and sprang at me. Yes, Dandy. He
was in a fury. His eyes burned with ferocity.
I dodged him by a miracle, dropped the pail,
and ran back to the house shrieking for help.
When I entered the living-room my husband
feigned to be waking out of sleep. He
didn’t seem interested in my story, and I’m
convinced that he had planned the whole
thing.’ It was past my understanding how
Dearth could have made his horse spring out of
his stable and make a murderous attack upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
particular woman, and I said so. ‘You don’t
know him yet,’ retorted Monica. ‘And you
don’t know Dandy. Go and look at the beast.
Go now, while James is out.’</p>

<p>The farmyard, with its pool of water covered
in green slime, its manure and sodden straw,
and its smell of pigs, was a place that seldom
failed to offend me. But on this occasion I
picked my way across the cobblestones thinking
of nothing at all but the homicidal horse that
I was about to spy upon. I have said before
that I’m not a courageous man, and you’ll
understand that I stepped warily as I neared
the stable. I saw that the lower of the two
doors was made fast and with the more confidence
unlatched the other.</p>

<p>I peered in. The great horse stood, bolt
upright but apparently in a profound sleep.
It was indeed a fine creature, with no spot or
shadow, as far as I could discern, to mar its
glossy whiteness. I stood there staring and
brooding for several minutes, wondering if
both Monica and I were the victims of some
astounding hallucination. I had no fear at all
of Dandy, after having seen him; and it
didn’t alarm me when, presently, his frame
quivered, his eyes opened, and he turned to
look at me. But as I looked into his eyes an
indefinable fear possessed me. The horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
stared dumbly for a moment, and his nostrils
dilated. Although I half-expected him to tear
his head out of the halter and prance round
upon me, I could not move. I stared, and as
I stared, the horse’s lips moved back from the
teeth in a grin, unmistakably a grin, of
malign intelligence. The gesture vividly
recalled Dearth to my mind. I had described
him as equine, and if proof of the word’s
aptness were needed, Dandy had supplied that
proof.</p>

<p>‘He’s come back,’ Monica murmured to me,
on my return to the house. ‘Ill, I think.
He’s gone to lie down. Have you seen
Dandy?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. And I hope not to see him again.’</p>

<p>But I was to see him again, twice again.
The first time was that same night, from my
bedroom window. Both my bedroom and my
cousin’s looked out upon that grassy hill of
which I spoke. It rose from a few yards until
almost level with the second storey of the
house and then abruptly curved away. Somewhere
about midnight, feeling restless and
troubled by my thoughts, I got out of bed
and went to the window to take an airing.</p>

<p>I was not the only restless creature that night.
Standing not twenty yards away, with the sky
for background, was a great horse. The moonlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
made its white flank gleam like silver,
and lit up the eyes that stared fixedly at my
window.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>For sixteen days and nights we lived, Monica
and I, in the presence of this fear, a fear none
the less real for being non-susceptible to
definition. The climax came suddenly, without
any sort of warning, unless Dearth’s idiotic
hostility towards myself could be regarded
as a warning. The utterly unfounded idea
that I was making love to his wife had taken
root in the man’s mind, and every day his
manner to me became more openly vindictive.
This was the cue for my departure, with warm
thanks for my delightful holiday; but I didn’t
choose to take it. I wasn’t exactly in love with
Monica, but she was my comrade in danger
and I was reluctant to leave her to face her
nightmare terrors alone.</p>

<p>The most cheerful room in that house was
the kitchen, with its red-tiled floor, its oak
rafters, and its great open fireplace. And
when in the evenings the lamp was lit and we
sat there, listening in comfort to the everlasting
gale that raged round the house, I
could almost have imagined myself happy, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
it not been for the presence of my reluctant
host. He was a skeleton at a feast, if you
like! By God, we were a genial party.
From seven o’clock to ten we would sit there,
the three of us, fencing off silence with the
most pitiful of small talk. On this particular
night I had been chaffing him gently, though
with intention, about his fancy for keeping a
loaded rifle hanging over the kitchen mantelpiece;
but at last I sickened of the pastime,
and the conversation, which had been sustained
only by my efforts, lapsed. I stared at the
red embers in the grate, stealing a glance
now and again at Monica to see how she was
enduring the discomfort of such a silence. The
cheap alarum clock ticked loudly, in the way
that cheap alarum clocks have. When I
looked again at Dearth he appeared to have
fallen asleep. I say ‘appeared,’ for I instantly
suspected him of shamming sleep in order to
catch us out. I knew that he believed us to
be in love with each other, and his total lack of
evidence must have occasioned him hours of
useless fury. I suspected him of the most
melodramatic intentions: of hoping to see a
caress pass between us that would justify him
in making a scene. In that scene, as I figured
it, the gun over the mantelpiece might play
an important part. I don’t like loaded guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>The sight of his closed lids exasperated me
into a bitter speech designed for him to overhear.
‘Monica, your husband is asleep. He
is asleep only in order that he may wake at the
chosen moment and pour out the contents
of his vulgar little mind upon our heads.’</p>

<p>This tirade astonished her, as well it might.
She glanced up, first at me, then at her husband;
and upon him her eyes remained fixed.
‘He’s not asleep,’ she said, rising slowly out
of her chair.</p>

<p>‘I know he’s not,’ I replied.</p>

<p>By now she was at his side, bending over
him. ‘No,’ she remarked coolly. ‘He’s
dead.’</p>

<p>At those words the wind outside redoubled
its fury, and it seemed as though all the anguish
of the world was in its wail. The spirit of
Dearth’s Farm was crying aloud in a frenzy
that shook the house, making all the windows
rattle. I shuddered to my feet. And in the
moment of my rising the wail died away, and
in the lull I heard outside the window a sudden
sound of feet, of pawing, horse’s feet. My
horror found vent in a sort of desperate
mirth.</p>

<p>‘No, not dead. James Dearth doesn’t die so
easily.’</p>

<p>Shocked by my levity, she pointed mutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
to the body in the chair. But a wild idea
possessed me, and I knew that my wild idea
was the truth. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘that may
be dead as mutton. But James Dearth is
outside, come to spy on you and me. Can’t
you hear him?’</p>

<p>I stretched out my hand to the blind cord.
The blind ran up with a rattle, and, pressed
against the window, looking in upon us, was
the face of the white horse, its teeth bared in a
malevolent grin. Without losing sight of the
thing for a moment, I backed towards the
fire. Monica, divining my intention, took
down the gun from its hook and yielded it to
my desirous fingers. I took deliberate aim,
and shot.</p>

<p>And then, with the crisis over, as I thought,
my nerves went to rags. I sat down limply,
Monica huddled at my feet; and I knew with
a hideous certitude that the soul of James
Dearth, violently expelled from the corpse
that lay outside the window, was in the room
with me, seeking to re-enter that human body
in the chair. There was a long moment of
agony during which I trembled on the verge of
madness, and then a flush came back into the
dead pallid cheeks, the body breathed, the
eyes opened.... I had just enough strength
left to drag myself out of my seat. I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Monica’s eyes raised to mine; I can never for
a moment cease to see them. Three hours
later I stumbled into the arms of the stationmaster,
who put me in the London train under
the impression that I was drunk. Yes, I
left alone. I told you I wasn’t a courageous
man....</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Bailey’s voice abruptly ceased. The tension
in my listening mind snapped, and I came back
with a jerk, as though released by a spring, to
my seat in the tea-shop. Bailey’s queer eyes
glittered across at me for a moment, and then,
their light dying suddenly out, they became
infinitely weary of me and of all the sorry
business of living. A rationalist in grain, I
find it impossible to accept the story quite as it
stands. Substantially true it may be, probably
is, but that it has been distorted by the prism
of Bailey’s singular personality I can hardly
doubt. But the angle of that distortion must
remain a matter for conjecture.</p>

<p>No such dull reflections came then to mar my
appreciation of the quality of the strange hush
that followed his last words. Neither of us
spoke. An agitated waitress made us aware
that the shop was closing, and we went into
the street without a word. The rain was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
unremitting. I shrank back into the shelter
of the porch while I fastened the collar of my
mackintosh, and when I stepped out upon the
pavement again, Bailey had vanished into the
darkness.</p>

<p>I have never ceased to be vexed at losing
him, and never ceased to fear that he may have
thought the loss not unwelcome to me. My
only hope is that he may read this and get into
touch with me again, so that I may discharge
my debt to him. It is a debt that lies heavily
on my conscience—the price of this story, less
one pound.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GHOST</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SEVEN days leave—how exhilarating!
Freedom was wine in the mouth. And
though of those seven days only three remained
he was still enjoying a delirious intoxication.
He had learned the art of squeezing the present
moment dry, of living with all his heart in a
happy now, when he reached one, regarding
the long intervals of wretchedness as unmeaning
parentheses.</p>

<p>‘I was a silly fellow not to get here earlier.
But you know what relatives are.’</p>

<p>‘You were both silly and horrid,’ answered
his hostess. But her eyes danced with pleasure
as they met his, and the two friends exchanged
a smile of understanding. This was their
good time, and they would make the most of
it, wasting no regret on the past and admitting
to their hearts no fear of the great black future
that loomed, like a beast of prey, ready to
shatter their happiness with a blow of its paw.
It was a most delightful friendship, and that
it depended on mutual liking alone, and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
no sort of conventional tie, constituted not the
least of its charm. Dressed in a white tub-frock,
her small face from under a drooping
sun-hat flushing with excitement, Betty—publicly
known as Mrs. Charles Cowley—looked
exquisitely cool and fresh and young,
younger even than her years, which numbered
twenty-seven. It did Arnold’s eyes good to
look at her, and it sent a warm thrill through
his romantic heart that he was able to enjoy
that comforting sight, able to bask in her jolly
friendliness, without a thought of disloyalty
towards her husband, his old friend Charles.
So far as he could feel sorry for anyone this
morning he was a little sorry for Charles: not
because Charles was an ill-paid clerk, nor
because Charles’s was a retentive firm conspiring
with medical officers to defeat his patriotic
ambition, but merely because on this day of
all days he had to remain cooped up in the
city, poor devil.</p>

<p>He put his head out of the kitchen window
and inhaled the summer air in long rapturous
draughts. Jove, what a day for picnicking!</p>

<p>‘Hullo!’ cried Betty, at his back. ‘What
do you think you’re achieving by that? You
can’t stop to do your breathing exercises now.
Why, you haven’t packed the sandwiches yet!’</p>

<p>Arnold wheeled round and saluted her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
military fashion—a form of humour then in
vogue. ‘Sorry, sir!... Anyhow, have you
finished washing up your dixies?’</p>

<p>Betty regarded him with severity. ‘Yes, of
course. Haven’t I got my hat on and waiting
for you!’</p>

<p>He repeated the question reflectively.
‘Haven’t I got my hat on and waiting for
you?... In what sense is your hat waiting
for me, Betty? As the dear general said in
Bernard Shaw, I’m only a silly soldier-man.
Don’t harass my poor intelligence.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, grammar!’ She annihilated grammar
with one pout. Her quick fingers stacked
the sandwiches, and wrapped them in grease
paper snatched from the table drawer. ‘Come
along.... No, <i>I’m</i> going to carry the haversack.
You bring the thermos.’</p>

<p>They stepped out of the bungalow and into
rural Buckinghamshire. It was certainly a
unique morning. Earth had never before
been so fresh, breathed such fragrance; never
before had the sky bent so intimately over her.
After an hour’s walking down narrow lanes
between sweet-smelling hedgerows, and over
hills bordered by pinewoods, the two friends
turned into a field-path. Tall feathery grasses,
red-brown dock-flowers and yellow charlock
trembled ever so slightly as in a trance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
ecstasy; clover and ladies’-fingers, buttercups
and celandine seemed to Arnold’s imagination
to be so many mute faces, absurdly knowing,
wonderfully content. When they reached
their second stile he paused, and Betty with
him. The meadow beyond was a symphony
in green and yellow: a curving sweep of long
grass and buttercups, dazzled with sunlight;
and on the far side, by a pond, black-and-white
cows were browsing in the shadow of tall elms,
some dreaming over a celestial cud, some stooping
to the water, some cropping the jade-green
grass with soft enfolding lips.</p>

<p>‘How still it looks,’ said Betty.</p>

<p>He nodded, drowsed by beauty, yet stabbed
by beauty’s pain. He wondered if he were
seeing this vision of England for the last time.
‘And how alive,’ he answered. ‘It’s as if the
whole field were breathing and feeling. Dare
we go into it? It’s like walking over some
one’s face.’</p>

<p>Perhaps in that moment that three-days-hence
future thrust its ugly face into Betty’s.
Perhaps she recalled Arnold’s solitary lapse
from soldierly reticence, when he had said:
‘It’s not the actual fighting or the danger.
It’s the filth. And chance sights. A decaying
human hand sticking out of the side of a
trench—things like that.’ Perhaps she recalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
this, for her face grew unaccountably tense.</p>

<p>‘Come along, Arnold, that’s where we’re
going to have lunch. By that stream.’ She
scrambled over the stile before he could offer
to help her. He followed in a more leisurely
fashion, a little disappointed that she had
broken the spell of that meadow’s loveliness.</p>

<p>They sauntered across the field, and climbed
another stile. Then, skirting the hedge to the
left, they followed the brook until they found
an agreeable resting-place on the sloping grassed
bank. They sat down a few yards from the
pond where, as in a picture, the cows were
grouped, knee-deep in cool grass. Into that
little lake, which reflected the sky’s blue and
gold, the brook ran clear over a pebbly bed.
Arnold, embracing his knees, rested his chin
on them and stared into the water, admiring
the contours and colours of the smooth,
delicately-enamelled stones, and straining the
imagination to share the lives of the minute
creatures that were borne past in the stream.
Betty watched him with a covert sidelong look.</p>

<p>A unique morning, yes; and a unique
friendship of which Arnold was immeasurably
proud. Beautifully at peace, he found delight
in contemplating their relationship. He and
Betty were the most staunch of comrades.
There was implicit trust between them, unshakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
fidelity, and never a thought of love. He
could not believe that ever before had a man
and a girl achieved such intimacy without
being betrayed into a wish for a more passionate
symbol of that intimacy than mere talk. But
to Arnold, who was still in his earliest twenties,
talk was the best thing in the world. And
what talks he had had with Betty! With
what glorious candour she had disclosed to
him the secret places of her mind, places to
which even her mother and sisters had never
been admitted! For Arnold it was a fascinating
and a sacred experience; and if Betty’s
respect for his intellect was exaggerated, her
absolute trust in his honour was at least well-founded.
It was this absolute trust that added
to their friendship the delicious flavour of
romance. They exchanged ideas—on life, on
religion, on sex, especially on sex—with utter
unreserve, and with no hint of concession to
vulgar notions of propriety.</p>

<p>‘Look at those jolly little red worms,’ said
Arnold, pointing to the water. ‘I used to
dote on those things when I was a kid.’</p>

<p>‘They’re lovely.’ Betty paused before adding,
a trifle consciously: ‘Childhood’s the
best time, isn’t it? I wish I had a baby.’</p>

<p>He glanced up with quick interest. ‘Well,
why not?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>‘Ah, why! I’ve been married five years.
At first we couldn’t afford it, and now—well,
something’s wrong. For two years or more
we’ve been hoping for a child.’</p>

<p>‘Rotten luck!’ Arnold looked back at the
stream.</p>

<p>‘Yes. I wanted to tell you. You see,
there’s something wrong with Charlie.’</p>

<p>Arnold became alarmed. ‘Something ...
physiological?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. The doctor told him. Nothing very
dreadful, I believe, in the ordinary way. But
it makes it improbable that he’ll ever have a
child.’</p>

<p>‘And he wants one?’</p>

<p>Betty turned her head away for one moment.
‘<i>I</i> want one; I want one bitterly. And he
too, in his way.’</p>

<p>Arnold kept his gaze steadily upon the
moving water, lest he should see her tears.
He was shocked to think that this girl, so
robust, so affectionate, so ripe for motherhood,
should be cheated by the accident of marriage
of a tremendous experience. And why must
it be so? In a sensible society would it be
so? Before he had begun to work out all the
implications of that challenge, Betty spoke
again.</p>

<p>He was amazed to hear her phrasing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
own thoughts. ‘If people were decent-minded,
it wouldn’t so much matter,’ she said.
‘There could be a temporary marriage with
someone else.’</p>

<p>Arnold was delighted with this proof of her
emancipation. ‘Exactly. Nothing simpler.
But society won’t change in a hurry. No use
waiting for society. It rests with you and
Charlie.’</p>

<p>‘He would agree, of course. He would do
anything for my happiness.’</p>

<p>Arnold glowed in agreement. Charles was
a good fellow, the best fellow in the world;
he had a level head and a wonderfully rational
outlook. Nothing niggardly about Charles....
And then an extraordinary thought
presented itself. Why could not he himself
give Betty her heart’s desire? Could she
possibly have any such notion in her mind?
Was it possible that she liked him enough for
that? The dream blossomed in his imagination.
He saw the baby laughing up at him
from its cradle; saw it growing up as the son
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cowley. He himself
would see the boy—for a boy it would
be—only occasionally, and he would be known
as ‘Uncle Arnold’ or some such nonsense.
The situation would be quite impossibly
romantic, like something in a novel, and yet a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
triumph of decency and good sense over vulgar
middle-class morality. Betty and he would
resume their friendship unchanged and desiring
no change. His respect for her was invincible.
She was the wife of his friend, and that she
would always be. He conceived the whole
episode dispassionately, an act of pure friendship.
Was it possible that she...? No,
it was not possible. Talk was all very well,
but confronted with the need for action she
would falter. His thoughts had been mere
presumption. Some other man, perhaps, but
he—he could not expect so great an honour,
and certainly he could not seek it. If she had
meant that she would have said so. Of that
he was sure. He dared not make a suggestion
that might be repellent to her: she would be
so cruelly embarrassed, and the perfection of
their comradeship would be marred for ever.</p>

<p>And yet, in a situation so excessively delicate,
he must venture something if he wished to be
her friend. He tried to say: ‘You know I
too would do anything to make you happy.’
But the words as they formed in his mind
frightened him. How could he make her
realize the utter purity and loyalty of his
desires?</p>

<p>Despite his bewilderment he felt the moment
to be exquisitely rich in beauty and in destiny.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
The pause lengthened. At last he stammered,
‘In that event, of course, you would ask ...
some friend.’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’ Betty’s tone was cold. ‘Forgive
me for boring you.’ She jumped up. ‘I’m
getting stiff. Shall we move on?’</p>

<p>Something had gone wrong. Arnold grappled
feverishly with the incomprehensible.
Had he said too much? No, too little. Betty
was already walking away. He could see only
her back. When he caught her up, the sight
of her pride made him angry with himself;
yet he felt tongue-tied. He knew that he had
failed her in a supreme crisis. Could he have
had that opportunity again he would for her
sake have risked all, and said, ‘Let me be the
father of your child.’ But she was talking
now, rather volubly and consciously, of indifferent
things. Nothing would ever be the
same again. Anger, jealous anger, flamed in
his heart against the child, never to be born,
who stood like a ghost between them, severing
their friendship.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HOUSE AT MAADI</h2>
</div>


<h3>PART THE FIRST<br>

<i>An Afternoon in April</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">‘UGLINESS, squalor, is only a nuisance,’
he told himself. ‘It is beauty that
hurts.’ Even in the house at Maadi, the
house that held Rosemary Fairfield, he could
lose himself in musing; and he remained lost
until he became aware that a tall elderly woman
with fine eyes and silvering hair moved across
the room to greet him.</p>

<p>‘You’re Mr. Redshawe, of course. I’m
Rosemary’s mother. It was so good of you
to come.’ The young man’s evident shyness
moved her to add, ‘You <i>have</i> met Rosemary,
haven’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Thank you.’ He found his voice at last.
‘Yes, I had that pleasure three days ago in
Cairo. She was in the company of Mr. Bunnard,
my chief.’</p>

<p>‘My brother-in-law,’ said Mrs. Fairfield.
‘You like your work?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>‘Well,’ began Redshawe, ‘an Irrigation
Company....’</p>

<p>His hostess smiled. At ease now, and reposing
in the charm of her Irish voice and the
kindliness of her speaking eyes, he smiled in
return. As he looked into her lined face he
felt that by holding himself very still he could
almost hear the silken rustle of beauty’s vanishing
skirts.</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ Mrs. Fairfield said, leaning forward
a little, ‘does my brother-in-law do any
work, or do you and the rest do it all?’</p>

<p>He stared a moment at the dubious crease
in his trousers. When he looked up, with a
slight smile, ‘I’ve a tremendous respect for
Mr. Bunnard,’ he assured her. ‘More than
respect, if it’s not presumptuous to say so.
But of course he’s a very big wig indeed, don’t
you see? It’s only natural that he shouldn’t
<i>do</i> very much.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield glowed maternally at the
sight of his blushes.</p>

<p>‘How very nice you are,’ she surprised herself
by saying, with the shadow of a tremor
in her voice. ‘I’m so glad you came.’</p>

<p>He blushed again as he answered: ‘I’m
most amazingly glad. I was terrified at first.’</p>

<p>Her smile was friendlier than ever.</p>

<p>‘Not of me, I’m sure. Of Mrs. Bunnard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
perhaps. She is a very positive person—always
has been.’</p>

<p>He wanted to blurt out: ‘No, it was your
daughter that I was afraid of’; but he could
not shake off the grip of his reticence.</p>

<p>‘So are all of that cult,’ he said. ‘They
teach one their entertaining guesswork as
though it were an exact science.... And Miss
Fairfield—is she too a believer?’</p>

<p>‘Rosemary is rather a baffling girl,’ replied
Rosemary’s mother. ‘She spends a lot of
time with her aunt, and listens, listens. Yes,
that is almost all there is to be said about Rosemary:
she listens. At this moment she is
no doubt at the Cairo Lodge, hearing about
Yoga and Prana and Kamaloka.’</p>

<p>‘And other patent breakfast foods,’ said
Redshawe, with a cadence so bitter as to bring
wonder into his new friend’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘It would be a pity, don’t you think,’ he
answered the question in her glance, ‘if she
took all that stuff seriously?’</p>

<p>‘Aren’t <i>you</i> a little positive?’ she quizzed
him.... ‘Ah, here is Mr. Bunnard.’</p>

<p>Almost boyishly diffident, the spare familiar
figure of Redshawe’s chief sidled towards them.
Mr. Bunnard was rather above medium height,
but his earnest concentration on the pattern
of the carpet made him seem smaller. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
he raised his head a pair of ingenuous wondering
eyes peered, through the circular lenses of his
gold-rimmed spectacles, upon a new world.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Redshawe,’ said Mr. Bunnard, focussing
his mild radiance upon the young man
as they shook hands, ‘you’ve come then. How
very nice.’</p>

<p>‘You’re just in time to tell us about the
Atlantians, Dick,’ Mrs. Fairfield greeted him,
with the air of having been discussing the
Atlantians all the afternoon.</p>

<p>‘<i>Very</i> nice,’ repeated Mr. Bunnard, peering
from one to the other.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’ve come, sir,’ said Redshawe, ‘and
I’ve brought every one of my seven bodies
with me.’</p>

<p>Mr. Bunnard considered this remark with a
smile that revealed for the fraction of a second
an excellent set of artificial teeth.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you haven’t forgotten our little talk
then.... But you’ve got a lot to learn yet.
Seven planes and all interpenetrating. Is
Hypatia at home, Sheila?’</p>

<p>‘My dear Dick! She is at the Lodge, of
course, and Rosemary is with her. I expect
we had better not wait tea for them. They’ll
probably have something in Cairo.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps Hassan will get us some tea,’ ventured
Mr. Bunnard, ‘if we ask him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>As though to his cue, the white-smocked,
red-tarbooshed Hassan, the Berber servant,
appeared at this moment in the doorway bringing
tea on a large tray. In response to Mrs.
Fairfield’s nod he shuffled noiselessly into the
room, bowing and smirking in his expansive
Oriental fashion, and set out the tea-things on
an occasional table.</p>

<p>‘Seven planes and all interpenetrating,’ said
Mr. Bunnard, appearing to extract a peculiar
comfort from the idea. ‘We generally take
tea in the French manner—or is it the Russian?—with
lemon juice instead of milk. By the
by, I’ve got some Thought Forms up in
my den, Redshawe, that might interest you.
Angry, affectionate, ambitious, pure, envious,
sensual, and so on: all accurately coloured,
you know. I’ve spent a lot of time on them.
You’re not eating anything. I can recommend
the shortbread: it came all the way from
Scotland.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield, roused by a sound outside,
turned in the act of filling Redshawe’s cup for
the fifth time, to look out of the window.</p>

<p>‘Here are the truants,’ she said, ‘and we’ve
nearly finished.’ And Redshawe, following her
glance, saw the miraculous Rosemary standing
on the gravel path outside. To his excited
imagination it seemed that she was but for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
instant poised lightly upon this globe before
flying back to the paradise from which she
had descended.</p>

<p>Then indeed came the whirlwind followed
by the still small voice. Mrs. Bunnard, tall,
angular, and, though quiet, masterful, with
conscious power invaded the room: power
which, however, broke like a spent wave on
the adamant rock of Redshawe’s absorption in
Rosemary Fairfield.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Redshawe, how are you?’ said Mrs.
Bunnard, grasping his hand. ‘We have never
been introduced, but I know you perfectly.
This is my niece.’</p>

<p>‘We have met already,’ fell like a benediction
from the lips of Rosemary, as she gave
him her hand.</p>

<p>‘Now let us take our things off,’ said Mrs.
Bunnard with ferocious good humour. ‘Come,
Rosemary!’</p>

<p>A moment later Redshawe was conscious of
having stared at the departing vision. The
exodus completed by Mr. Bunnard, he turned
to find the thoughtful eyes of Rosemary’s
mother upon him. Divining that she had
read some of his mind he became confused.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield rose to ring the bell: an
action so startling to the disordered nerves of
Redshawe that he breathed deep relief when,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
a moment later, he heard her ask Hassan to
make some fresh tea for the ladies. His
hostess came back into the bay of the room
and stared out at the clustering purple masses
of bougainvillea that hung from the white
house, her hands playing listlessly with a fly-whisk.</p>

<p>‘This is the coolest part of the house till
the sun goes down,’ she said, in a tone so void
of expression as to fix his instant attention.
‘Afterwards we will sit out on the piazza, and
perhaps Rosemary will play to us.’</p>

<p>‘That will be delightful,’ he answered,
politely acquiescent; but his mind was asking:
‘What is the matter? What is she going to
say?’</p>

<p>He became agitated with the expectation of
hearing something momentous about Rosemary.
But, after a pause, Mrs. Fairfield did but add
the commonplace remark that his was an
uncommon name.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’ Disappointment and relief strove
together in his tone.</p>

<p>‘Are you the son of a certain Stephen Redshawe,
I wonder?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he said again, with quickening interest.</p>

<p>‘You have his eyes,’ she assured him with
a smile, and turned quickly to the window.</p>

<p>‘By Jove, you knew my father?’ He got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
out of his chair in his astonishment, and found
himself, with a sense of shock, face to face
with an old woman who smiled at him wanly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, many years ago.’</p>

<p>‘He never mentioned——’ he began; and
stopped, blushing for his gaucherie. As if in
atonement, ‘Please talk to me about my father,
if it won’t distress you,’ he pleaded.</p>

<p>After a long silence, ‘Not now,’ she said.
‘There’s a story I can never tell you. But
we’re going to be good friends, you and I,
and some day we’ll have a long talk about
your father.’</p>

<p>Embarrassed, he murmured lame thanks.</p>

<p>‘There’s forty years between us,’ she added,
half to herself. ‘So we shall be good friends.’</p>

<p>The door was slightly ajar and in the contracted
doorway flashed the smile of Mr.
Bunnard.</p>

<p>‘Come along, Redshawe,’ chirped Mr. Bunnard.
‘The ladies are coming down to their
tea. Slip away while you can and have a look
at my Thought Forms.’</p>

<p>Redshawe, obeying this unwelcome summons,
mused deeply on the story that he was
never to hear.</p>

<h3>PART THE SECOND<br>

<i>Sheila Dyrle</i></h3>

<h4>1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">SOMEWHERE, no doubt, in Sheila’s
personality, the story was written down;
and she could have turned for young Redshawe
the pages that she so seldom and so
reluctantly turned for herself. She was an
emotional but not a sentimental woman, and
retrospect was a melancholy luxury that for
the most part she denied herself. So far as
she could she denied it to herself now, although
the young man had troubled the deep waters
of her mind. If for a moment she looked back
her life appeared to her as a fruitless quest for
something—who knows what?—for beauty,
for happiness, for an absolute and harmonious
intimacy, for everlasting fulfilment in a love
that is the answer to all questions. Intimations
of such a reality had again and again
quickened desire within her. But, even in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
moment of stretching out the hands to clasp
it, ‘beauty vanishes, beauty passes’....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Half a century before, in her early teens,
Sheila had emerged from her sister’s bedroom
into the green distempered corridor of the
school infirmary, hotly denying in her heart
that Helena was dying. She wondered at the
obtuseness of these people who had seen the
sweet bloom of Helena’s cheeks and the lustre
of her eyes, and yet drained their vocabulary
of euphemisms hinting at death. Weak and
wasted indeed she was, but full, still, of the
serene joy that was her peculiar gift to the
world. God couldn’t be so foolish or so cruel
as to let Helena die. That would surely have
been too sorry a joke even for the deity of
Aunt Hester’s imagination.</p>

<p>‘Why is every one so silly?’ she complained
to Aunt Hester, who had waited in trembling
silence till her coming. ‘Helena’s getting
better. Of course she is.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear,’ agreed Aunt Hester submissively.
‘Did you have a nice talk?’</p>

<p>‘We couldn’t let her talk much. She’s still
so weak. But she said she would soon be out
and about again.’</p>

<p>Tears began trickling down the lined leathery
cheeks of Aunt Hester: cheeks that had suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the grotesque air of having been corrugated
for the sole purpose of being wept upon.
‘Poor darling! Did she say that?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, aunt, why will you believe those silly
people?’ Sheila’s voice rang out. ‘She must
get well—she <i>must</i>!’</p>

<p>‘We must hope on,’ quavered Aunt Hester,
furtively dabbing her eyes with a little sodden
ball of handkerchief.</p>

<p>Sheila, alone in her faith, succumbed to the
fear that tried to hide itself in anger. ‘It’s
too bad,’ she said. ‘It’s a beastly shame ...
to give up hope. Think how <i>well</i> she looks!
She’s been making plans for the summer
holidays.’</p>

<p>At that Aunt Hester turned away her head,
hunched up her back, and frankly sobbed,
leaning against the back of a chair. All her
prim dignity had vanished, and for the first time
Sheila saw in her aunt an old frail woman.
The shock of that discovery passing, she stared
for a moment in sullen misery at the queer-shaped
convulsive figure; then turned abruptly
away and went, dry-eyed, into their bedroom.</p>

<p>In bed she thought she could hear her sister’s
voice in delirium, although she knew that
there were two walls and a passage between
them: it muttered interminably until she had
to bite her lips together to prevent herself from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
screaming. Aunt Hester soon came into the
room, undressed herself by moonlight, and
tumbled on to her knees. She remained
kneeling, with her face and arms lying limply
across her bed, for what seemed hours; and
Sheila stared stupidly at the ceiling and strained
her ears at every trivial sound. For a moment
she closed her eyes....</p>

<p>And when she opened them again, birds
were chattering outside her window and pale
dawnlight, like a ghost, was in the room.
‘Like a ghost,’ Sheila said, and shuddered.
Aunt Hester was not there; her bed had not
been slept in.</p>

<p>Sheila got quickly out of bed, a dry sob of
fear breaking from her, and ran barefooted
into the green corridor. She stood quite
motionless for a while, one hand resting on
the door handle, and listened; tiptoed a few
steps up the passage, her eyes fixed dreadfully
on the room that held Helena; and drew back
again. Time became a throbbing agony. Her
thought dizzied itself by ceaselessly revolving
round the glazed white door that had brass
figures, 17, screwed upon its middle panel, but
her eyes steadily stared. ‘Seventeen,’ said
some chattering thing in her brain: ‘that’s
her age. Is that why they put 17, or is it a
coincidence?’ But she was not to be distracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
by silly questions. The door began
to open.</p>

<p>Slowly the glazed white door that had stared
back at her for so long, mutely reiterating ‘17,’
began to open, as though it had come to life.
‘A big white waistcoat,’ said Sheila’s chattering
brain. Like a silly flat face it moved aside
to make room for something that with funereal
step passed out: a bent figure in black tight-fitting
bodice and white lace cap. Aunt
Hester’s right hand drew the door to behind
her, and with an abrupt resolute gesture she
flung up her head and stood, regally tall, a
black figure of doom framed in the white doorway.
In a silence like death itself the eyes
of these two stricken creatures met.</p>

<p>That meeting of eyes was an icy blast in the
green twilit corridor. It froze the running
water of Sheila’s thought and made her catch
her breath. Gradually, while they looked at
each other, Aunt Hester crumpled and shrank
again to the meagre dimensions of a bent old
woman; she stumbled forward to meet her
niece with feebly gesticulating arms. The
next morning she had answered the mute
question of Sheila’s eyes and was enfolding her
rigid passive body.</p>

<p>The single word she saw forming on her
aunt’s lips released the locked flow of Sheila’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
thought. Her mind became once more almost
insanely active. One dry gasp escaped her,
and no other sound. The springs of pity were
barren in her: this sobbing woman was a
stranger. Helena was dead. She turned away
from her aunt and went slowly back into the
bedroom. Helena was dead. ‘Very well,’
said Sheila’s mind, and she, ignoring that,
suddenly thought that if God were to appear
to her at that moment she would strike him
with her hand. And that would have been
how silly! He would only laugh. Helena
was dead. She stared, dry-eyed, out of the
window and saw the sun newly risen in his
glory. The leaves of the acacia were a luminous
green; a thrush in its branches poured out
bubbling melody. All the universe was alive
with a stabbing futile beauty. Helena was
dead.</p>

<p>No tears came to release the pent grief.
Why was that? ‘Like the woman in the
poem,’ muttered that mental chatterbox and
began iterating ‘Home they brought her
warrior dead. Home they brought her warrior
dead.’ It was in a little red book. ‘Rose a
nurse of ninety years.’ Was it ninety or
eighty? And Rose was a girl’s name, but it
wasn’t the nurse’s name. Rose a nurse. A
nurse rose. Rise, rose, risen. And on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
third day he rose again from the dead. Who
was it did that? The little red book had an
odd name on its cover.... And suddenly
Helena came before her, alive, alive, and happy
as she had always been. What nonsense.
Helena was dead.... Like a city besieged
Sheila fought against the cruel memories that
invaded her.</p>

<p>Aunt Hester came with food on a tray, and
urged her to try to eat something, just a morsel,
just a sip. What was the good of it all?
And the voice of Aunt Hester stayed with her
interpolating dull remarks about funerals,
trains, Penlington, nice to be home again, poor
dear mother, make a friend of Jesus, try not
to brood, into Sheila’s busy thought. But
Sheila pushed them all from her. She was
eager to brood. Without brooding, life was
empty: a dry husk. She surrendered herself
now, opened her heart to that host of memories:
they tumbled in, a looting rabble. She lived
over and over again her days with Helena:
her thought sped through the years ever more
quickly, until in a sickening rush it reached
the dead wall of the present. Helena was
dead, God had stupidly killed her. And
would they have to try to sing a hymn about—what
was it?—each within his narrow bed,
safe home at last, Jesu’s breast, blend the living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
with the dead.... Aunt Hester was back
again, urging her to cry. ‘You do the crying,
aunt.’ Had she said that or only thought
it? She wished Aunt Hester would go away
with her talk of the kind nurse, just a sip or
two, quite a peaceful passing dear, try to pray,
home again soon, take her with us. What was
the sense in saying ‘take her with us’ when
Helena was dead? There was nothing to
take home. There was nothing to take home
except what was in the white room, number
seventeen. They’d put it in a box ... not
Helena; Helena was gone away ... Sheila
was jealous of anything that came to thrust
itself between her and her memories; but she
could not still the almost febrile activity of her
aching brain: her random thoughts danced
on dizzily over the bottomless black pit.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Back in the house at Penlington. A locked
room now, with It, shut up in a shiny coffin,
on trestles. And to-day, at noon, It was to
be taken away.</p>

<p>Noon. The long-tailed black horses
trampled on Sheila’s heart. Six men entered
the house and mounted the stairs—tramp,
tramp, tramp—and stopped.... They
returned more slowly, their breathing more
noisy, their footsteps less regular. Sheila<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
turned her face from the window lest she should
find horror made visible.</p>

<p>She stood in the stuffy room, waiting for
the others to come downstairs. Although the
windows were wide open the atmosphere was
stiflingly hot. The drowsy hum in which
all summer sounds were merged floated in
oppressively, and the clock’s ticking was a
burden.</p>

<p>She was very uncomfortable and wretched
in her black clothes; her gloved hands perspired.
She caught sight, through the trees
in the garden, of the waiting carriage....
Why were all these things necessary?</p>

<p>Uncle Peter came downstairs, followed by
Aunt Hester and a school chum of Helena’s.
Other draped figures came, including a strange
girl-cousin with her husband; but none was
of the slightest consequence.</p>

<p>In the crawling carriage now; and idiot
birds were singing happily outside. Sunshine,
dusty roads, blue cloudless sky, hot air, silly
singing birds, the window-fittings in the carriage,
Uncle Peter with his expanse of waistcoat
and great gold chain and perspiring face,
the split in the third finger of her black glove,
the ill-repressed sniffling of the cousin, a scratch
in the paint over Uncle Peter’s head, the houses
and hedges moving slowly past them, people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
at the side of the road with raised hats, a team
of cricketers in a distant field and the gleam
of their white flannels in the sunlight: of all
these things she was conscious, and of the
black pit, Helena dead, and the slow miserable
rumble of wheels.</p>

<p>She wondered why God would not speak to
her. A new hope flickered. She would listen
for His voice, that still small voice in the soul.
But the only voice she heard, whether within
or without, was Uncle Peter’s. ‘It really <i>is</i>
hot,’ he said conversationally, as they got out
of the carriage.</p>

<p>And now added to the horror and the heat
was the sight of the coffin being borne into
that squat evil building, that house of death,
the cemetery chapel, and, presently, a dull
droning voice in melancholy monotone:</p>

<p>‘<i>In the morning it is green and groweth up;
but in the evening it is cut down, dried up and
withered. For when thou art angry all our days
are gone; we bring our years to an end as it
were a tale that is told. The days of our years
are three score years and ten.</i>’</p>

<p>And Sheila, a tiny girl again, was having
happy romps with Helena in a garden full of
flowers and sunshine. Helena was clapping
her hands and laughing; Helena was lifting
her, shoulder-high, to kiss a very tall rose that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
was really a princess imprisoned by black
magic.... And then she was going to
Helena for her music lesson, and Helena pretended
she was just an ordinary pupil (for that
was part of the game) named Linda Smith.
‘And what are you going to play this afternoon,
Linda?’...</p>

<p>‘<i>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death.</i>’</p>

<p>The man was still there, the long-faced
cadaverous man droning out his words. And
now they were out again in the scorching sun,
standing, the men bare-headed, round an open
grave. She heard the women sobbing; she
saw Uncle Peter with bent head, a great red
boil peeping over his collar from the pink folds
of neck. And now the coffin was being lowered.
Something seemed to clutch her by the
throat; but the tears would not come.</p>

<p>‘<i>For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God
of His great mercy....</i>’</p>

<p>‘Come along, dear,’ said Aunt Hester, taking
her arm. And Sheila, waking as from an evil
dream, saw compassion looking out of the eyes
of Uncle Peter. She was the centre of this
tragedy. For an instant she luxuriated in the
emotion of her position; enjoyed the accession
of self-importance; rolled mourning like syrup
on her tongue. She caught herself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
act; and her heart turned sour and said to
her, ‘How hateful you are!’</p>

<h4>2</h4>

<p>Helena’s death is of signal importance in
the history of Sheila because it was the occasion
of her first serious quarrel with God. And
though, as the years went on, she did in a
measure make it up with Him, the reconciliation
was never complete. She never ceased,
from that day, to relish Mr. Hardy’s gestures
of contempt for the President of the Immortals.
The name of God, none the less, resumed
something of its old majesty. She depersonalized
Him, disembodied Him, transmuted Him
from solid substance into a kind of immanent
gas, a presence that disturbed her with the
sense of elevated thoughts. She dabbled in
the literature of popular mysticism, deriving
comfort from its comfortable abstract phrases,
its Cosmic Urges, its Universal Self. She
read a text-book on Hegel; and the Hegelian
paradox, ‘Being and not-being are identical,’
she rolled on her tongue until it assumed the
flavour of truism. While she was on the crest
of this enthusiasm Kay Wilton came, to renew
the promise of a transcendental happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>But let us turn the pages more quickly until
we come upon a Sheila of nineteen years, with
the Kay adventure past but still fresh in her
mind. With her school-friend Hypatia Fairfield
she sat in a coign of the cliff at Selborne
and gazed musingly at sea and sky. Sheila
was too busy with her dream to be very interested
in Hypatia’s talk about her clever brother
who had just gone to Cambridge: his profound
knowledge of history, his intellectual
honesty, and his sarcasm poured so liberally
on a certain Paley whose <i>Evidences of Christianity</i>
he had been forced to study for the Little
Go. Slightly bored by the recital of this
brother’s deeds and sayings, Sheila began a
little to scorn her friend’s sisterly partiality.
Even the severe, the rational, the proudly
unconventional Hypatia was not immune from
that human weakness.</p>

<p>‘Have you ever liked anybody very much,
Hypatia?’</p>

<p>‘Liked anyone?’</p>

<p>‘A boy, I mean.’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course, Edward——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, not your brother.’ Sheila waved an
impatient hand. ‘Have you never been....’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean in love?’ asked Hypatia, in
some surprise.</p>

<p>‘Well, yes, in love.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>‘No.’ Hypatia shook her head, firmly, but
without the scorn that Sheila had half-expected
to see. ‘I never have. Why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I just wondered.’</p>

<p>For a moment Hypatia contemplated a distant
ship. ‘Look at the sun on that sail,’ she
said.... ‘Have <i>you</i> ever been?’</p>

<p>Sheila nodded, scrutinizing closely a smooth
white stone she had dug up with her fingers
from the chalky soil.</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Did he know?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. There was a kind of engagement.
It was while I was at St. Margaret’s.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean it’s over now?’</p>

<p>Sheila began trying to explain everything.
The effort took her away for a moment to the
first dim beginnings of love, four or five years
back, and then brought her swiftly to the greater
glory and deeper pain of the year just gone.
Hypatia listened with quiet attention to the
rambling, shy, and inadequate narration.</p>

<p>‘It was at a Band of Hope that I first saw
him,’ began Sheila.</p>

<p>‘What<i>ever</i> made you go to a Band of Hope?’
asked Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘I had a friend, Sophie Dewick. She used
to go. And they used to have lantern lectures
and concerts and things. It wasn’t bad.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>The lantern slides had been a disappointment,
being concerned almost entirely with graphical
statistics about alcohol. The only picture
worth while was that of a flea, magnified some
thousandfold, happily reminiscent of the <i>New
Geology Reader</i> and of Poe’s stories. This was
an inadequate sugar coating to the pill of
chemical analysis. But Mr. Beak made everything
worth while—Mr. Beak, with spare
figure, polished pate, and black bushy eyebrows.
When he rose, lifting his hand for
silence in order that he might announce ‘Hymn
Number twenty-thwee—the twenty-third
hymn,’ he seemed like a military commander
admitting defeat but determined not to surrender;
he seemed, to himself perhaps as to
his sympathizers, the last champion of sobriety
in a drunken world. This sense of desperate
purpose pervaded the whole proceedings of
which Mr. Beak had the conducting: the
religious service had always this invincible air
of being held round an open grave—the open
grave of one who, without doubt, had sipped
claret-cup at some festival in his youth and in
riper years had taken to wife-beating, smoking,
swearing, and the other vices incidental to
dipsomania. Mrs. Beak, plump, rosy, and
smiling, chatted pleasantly to every one and
made optimistic secretarial announcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>‘And that was where I met him,’ Sheila
told Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘Did you lose your heart at once?’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit. There was something about
him: I don’t know how to express it—a sort
of mute poetry in his face. But I didn’t really
give a thought to him then. He seemed a
nice boy; nothing more.’</p>

<p>Later she discovered that he had sad grey
eyes, a submissive mouth, untidy light brown
hair. He wore his high double collar and his
black tie with an incongruous effect, like a
cherub masquerading as a clerk. Sheila’s
interest in Kay, her urgent desire to protect
him, led her into strange places; for he was a
youth of inscrutable impulses. The Band of
Hope was good fun; and to accept sometimes
the hospitality of Sophie’s pew in a strange
chapel full of green gloom was a defection
from Wesleyanism that Aunt Hester found it
easy to forgive: the easier when she reflected
that it was a further step from the dreaded
Popery. But the Seven Days’ Mission was
something that taxed Sheila heavily. A new
humility was growing upon her; the beatific
vision of Kay drew her with a power she found
irresistible. So innocent, so shy a boy, so
unaware of his own attractiveness, he seemed
to be crying out for sympathy. She read an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
unspoken appeal in his big eyes; she discovered
a pathos of inexpressiveness in his
lame confused speeches. That he admired her
was a gradual revelation that at first she hardly
dared to face: that she longed to know him
and to be his friend she admitted to herself
at once with her usual candour. Why then
did this young prince, this strayed denizen of
the celestial meads, choose such odd ways of
spending his time? What force impelled him
to attend that curious orgy of emotion, the
Seven Days’ Mission? She found the riddle
hard to read. Humbly and patiently she set
herself the task of trying to understand these
religious fervours.</p>

<p>Sheila and Kay talked rarely, and never of
matters more deep than the Band of Hope,
<i>Pickwick Papers</i>, the weather, the oddities of
common acquaintances, and the mock-tragedy
in blank verse that Clive Bunter had written
for the Social Evening. The rehearsals for
this play drew them together every Tuesday
for four weeks; but the play was never presented
to the public, for the dress-rehearsal
was attended by Mr. Beak and Mr. Turley,
and these gentlemen, deacons both, were seized
with alarm at the prospect of theatricals, however
innocuous, taking place in a lecture-hall
so near the sacred precincts of the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Gloomily the actors dispersed to their several
homes.</p>

<p>‘What rot it is!’ said Kay.</p>

<p>‘But they were awfully funny, those two,’
Sheila remarked. ‘People so comic must
have a spark of goodness in them somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘Goodness!’ said Clive Bunter, ‘Gallons
and gallons of it. It ought to be put a stop to,
this monopoly of goodness. But as for brains—all
the brains in the Band of Hope wouldn’t
fill a pin’s head.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not including your own, are you?’
asked Kay.</p>

<p>Sheila, who considered Clive rather conceited,
laughed with relish. She was at some
pains to show her appreciation. Perhaps it
was this that encouraged Kay to ask, when,
later, she turned to leave the others: ‘May
I come a little way with you?’</p>

<p>She said ‘Please do,’ and pointedly refrained
from calling out ‘Good night’ to Sophie, who
was walking some yards ahead with the Hero
of the doomed play, a gentleman by whom of
late she had been rather engrossed.</p>

<p>Sheila and Kay walked for a while in silence
down a broad avenue of trees bordered on one
side by dark woods, and on the other by scattered
houses. A yellow strip of moon hung,
glowing in the blue, above the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>She began telling him that she was to be
sent away to St. Margaret’s, a school in Selborne;
that the term was thirteen weeks long;
and that her aunt talked of going to live in
Selborne permanently. This meant that she
and Kay might never meet again.</p>

<p>Kay surveyed this prospect dismally. They
discussed it in elaborately casual tones. And
all the while she was thinking how delicious
were the stillness and the moonlight and this
unspoken love. Even the impending separation
was beautiful, tragic, uplifting. When at
his suggestion they sat down on a borough
council seat facing the woods, she caught her
breath and trembled at the exquisite beauty of
his shy avoidance of her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Frightfully thick those woods are,’ he
said.</p>

<p>But that was said to gain time, she knew.
A feeling almost of fear came over her. He
was going to try to put into words this wonderful,
this unutterable love.... If only it
could remain unspoken, and they sit here for
ever in silence!</p>

<p>‘I say, Sheila,’ he burst out. ‘I wish you
weren’t going!’</p>

<p>‘Do you?’ She stared at the dark gravel
path.</p>

<p>‘Dash it all—I’m awfully fond of you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>She turned to him with flushed cheeks and
fluttering heart, trying to speak.</p>

<p>‘I think ... I think you’re a perfect dear,’
she said. ‘Oh, Kay!’</p>

<p>His eyes filled with light. Rather awkwardly
he put his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>They kissed shyly, hesitatingly, as though
afraid lest by doing so they should break the
spell of beauty that bound them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Hypatia listened, slightly frowning.</p>

<p>‘After that dress-rehearsal,’ said Sheila, ‘he
told me.’</p>

<p>‘Told you?’</p>

<p>‘Told me that he ... liked me. I knew
before, but he told me then.’</p>

<p>Her voice died away into silence.</p>

<p>‘Nothing can ever come near that,’ she said,
in a low tone. ‘Nothing, ever.’</p>

<p>She resumed her story after a pregnant
silence. The sound of the sea soothed her
with its rhythm.</p>

<p>‘A few days afterwards I came to St. Margaret’s.
And then....’</p>

<p>She stopped speaking. Hypatia looked up
to find her gaze fixed upon the horizon.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said Hypatia gently, after a long
pause. ‘Did he forget all about you or something
of that sort?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>‘No,’ answered Sheila, ‘he didn’t forget.
He kept writing me letters.’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course! Didn’t you want him
to?’...</p>

<p>The first letter made her eyes moist with
tenderness; but every one that followed came
with a whisper of impending tragedy. He
wrote always of the church, of the office, of the
garden, of the Band of Hope: round these
things his immortal soul revolved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Next Sunday fortnight I am to give a paper at the Young
People’s Bible Class. Mr. Dewick asked me if I would
and he said he would be very pleased if I would say yes and
I could not very well get out of it as I had no excuse ready.
I have chosen for my subject Sunday Observance; it is a
good subject but I find it hard to put many thoughts down
on paper about it. I will write and tell you how I get on.
We had a really broad-minded sermon last Sunday on the
text ‘By their fruits ye shall know them,’ it upset some of
the very strict people I fancy but Mr. Dewick liked it and
so did I. The preacher, whose name I forget, he was from
Barnet, said that there had been some quite good atheists,
but I thought he took a very extreme view when he said
that some atheists lived much better lives than the average
christian. It seemed to me that he put that bit in just so as
to sound paradoxical and daring. Father has been very
busy in the garden, pruning his roses, as the weather has
greatly improved these last few days. There is a new fellow
now at the office, but I cannot say I like him much, he is a
bit of a rough diamond; rough anyhow, I am not so sure
about the diamond. I think he drinks and he certainly uses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
bad language, but if one tells him of it he only gets more
offensive. By the by, isn’t it funny that you should be still
at school while I’m at business when we are both seventeen
and within a few months of each other?</p>
</div>

<p>Passages like this frightened Sheila by
indicating a gulf of mental disparity fixed
between Kay and her. ‘It’s only superficial,’
whispered her love. ‘He’s not like that
really. He’s not a good letter-writer: that’s
all.’ And she tried to silence her own critical
spirit with tender memories of his wooing.
‘Can love be scared away by a bad literary
style?’ she asked herself. But her mind
worked on against her: by no manner of
violence could she prevent its probing into the
substance of Kay’s frequent letters. In spite
of her protests it coined for her a new word,
Kayesque, to express a certain indefinable
quality, a taint, manifest in his way of thinking
and writing. Indefinable or not, it was
undefined, for she dared not define it. To
have confessed even to herself that it meant
complacency, mediocrity, total absorption in
the commonplace, would have precipitated
disaster.</p>

<p>And to quicken her faculty for detecting
the Kayesque there was the constant companionship
of Hypatia Fairfield. From the
moment when Sheila woke, one midnight, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
find Hypatia sitting up in bed reading by
candlelight <i>The City of Dreadful Night</i> the two
girls were fast friends. This was but one book
from the secret hoard of five that Hypatia
discovered to Sheila on that exciting night.
She found the school library altogether too
prim, too like Miss Fry the head, to suit her
taste.</p>

<p>‘They starve you here, don’t they?’ she
said, opening her locker and exhibiting her
treasures one by one.</p>

<p>Each one had a brown-paper cover bearing
in large block letters a title specially designed
to propitiate the eye of Authority, should
Authority happen to come round some day
with a master-key. <i>Foxe’s Book of Martyrs</i>
clothed with righteousness the impious pages
of Spencer’s <i>First Principles</i>, and <i>The Life of
Livingstone</i> invested <i>Monte Cristo</i> with a
garb of sanctity. Shelley beat his luminous
wings behind the broad back of Robinson
Crusoe.</p>

<p>‘It’s a pity Miss Fry is such a frump,’ said
Sheila, when they had got into their beds and
Hypatia had blown the light out.</p>

<p>Hypatia agreed. ‘I’m awfully glad you
woke up. We might never have got to know
each other if you hadn’t caught me reading.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t expect we should,’ responded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Sheila, glowing with the excitement of a new
friendship.</p>

<p>‘I was absolutely isolated,’ Hypatia said.
‘Oh, why ever didn’t you come to St. Margaret’s
before?’</p>

<p>Sheila laughed. ‘I would have done it if
I’d known, perhaps. And yet I was sorry to
leave my other school.’</p>

<p>‘Was it decent there?’</p>

<p>‘Well, they didn’t teach us much, but it
was very comfortable and homelike. I’d
practically grown up there. It was a day
school. They didn’t worry me much. Two
or three of us in the Sixth used to spend a lot
of our school hours producing a school mag.’</p>

<p>‘Unofficial, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘Very. We wrote it out by hand and
handed it round.’</p>

<p>‘Did you write stories, or what?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, things, you know,’ said Sheila. ‘It
was only a lark. A kind of skit on the official
journal.’</p>

<p>‘They’re too ladylike here for anything
so vulgar as journalism,’ complained Hypatia
to the darkness.</p>

<p>‘I expect so.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Fry with her Ministering Children!’
added Hypatia scornfully.... ‘By the way,
are you church, chapel, or what?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>‘The last,’ said Sheila. ‘I’m rather keen
on Edward Carpenter just now. Have you
read him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Whitman and water,’ replied Hypatia.
‘I’m an agnostic personally. So are my
people.’</p>

<p>‘Your people too!’ exclaimed Sheila. ‘I
thought one’s people were always orthodox.’</p>

<p>Hypatia laughed. ‘Are you Irish?’</p>

<p>‘Part of me is.’</p>

<p>‘The voice part,’ said Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘Mother was Irish, and father had some
Irish blood—just a drop or two.’</p>

<p>‘Your voice is lovely.’</p>

<p>Sheila heard Hypatia’s bed creak, and then
the sound of a match being struck. Hypatia
bent over her.</p>

<p>‘And you’ve Irish eyes too,’ she said. The
match flickered out, and she went back to
her bed. ‘They’re blue. Blue eyes and dark
hair.’</p>

<p>She struck off at a tangent.</p>

<p>‘You’ll like Spencer. He makes your
brain simmer. I said that before, didn’t I?
Especially on the Unknowable. Funny, some
people think there’s nothing unknowable.’</p>

<p>‘Beautiful people,’ said Sheila. ‘The salt
of the earth. You’d think, to hear them talk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
that they were present at the Creation of the
world taking shorthand notes.’</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>‘I believe I’m too excited to sleep,’ said
Sheila presently. ‘But I suppose we ought
to....’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For weeks together, in defiance of Kay’s
letters, Sheila abandoned herself to her dream
of love, and the Kay of her imagination was a
lover beyond criticism. It was become an
article of her faith that it was this perfect lover,
not the author of the letters, whom she would
meet again on her return from school. Him
she had indeed seen on the night of their love’s
visible flowering. They had but to be together
again, and she would know him for what he
was, master of a speech more eloquent than
words. And while she dreamed of this blissful
reunion a letter came that rent her heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Darling Sheila.</span>—Do not be surprised if I don’t write
for several days. Dad died suddenly yesterday.</p>

<p class="right">Your loving <span class="smcap">Kay</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>She recalled Helena’s death, re-living some of
that agony; and compassion for Kay wrung
bitter tears from her. Into her letter she
poured a torrent of love and pity and passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
protest. She yearned for the moment when
she would see him face to face and offer for his
comfort the balm of her lips.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘You see,’ explained Sheila, ‘I couldn’t tell
you then, Hypatia. It would have been
disloyal. I didn’t admit even to myself that
there was anything to spoil our happiness. I
thought that as soon as I saw him again, and
touched him, that horrible doubt would
vanish.’</p>

<p>‘And didn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, for a moment or two. Then it came
back ... and grew and grew ... to a hateful
certainty.’</p>

<p>‘Yes?’</p>

<p>‘The separation had lasted for the best part
of a year, because I didn’t go home for the
long summer holiday: Auntie came here
instead. And during that time we’d both
developed, he and I.’</p>

<p>‘He was more Kayesque than ever?’</p>

<p>Sheila flinched.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t remind me of that detestable
invention of mine,’ she begged.... ‘He’d
changed—oh, incredibly! Even his appearance.
There were still wonderful moments—sometimes
when the light fell on his hair ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and he was slightly freckled, you know,’ she
added.</p>

<p>‘But he was changed.’</p>

<p>‘He was just like his letters. And when
he was saying certain things—stuffy things—he
even <i>looked</i> like his letters.’</p>

<p>‘And the mute poetry?’ asked Hypatia
presently.</p>

<p>Sheila stared miserably at her own feet.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what became of that,’ she
confessed. ‘It was there, you know,’ she
added, seeing a gentle incredulous smile flit
over her friend’s face. ‘Hypatia, it was,
really. I <i>saw</i> it.’</p>

<p>‘And then——’ suggested Hypatia after a
silence.</p>

<p>‘Well, as soon as I was certain,’ said Sheila
simply, ‘I had to tell him, of course.’</p>

<p>‘That it was hopeless?’</p>

<p>Sheila nodded.</p>

<p>‘We lived in different worlds.... And of
course he didn’t understand.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Hypatia. ‘He wouldn’t. That
was the whole tragedy, wasn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘He thought—’ Sheila began, with a little
bitter laugh ... then stopped, and looked at
Hypatia with pain in her eyes. ‘He thought
I had stopped caring, Hypatia!’</p>

<p>She rose to her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>‘It must be getting on for teatime,’ she said.
‘Shall we go?’</p>

<h4>3</h4>

<p>Seven years later, on the platform of Penny’s
Heath station, Sheila discovered a new Hypatia
Fairfield: tall, dark, severe, with thoughtful
eyes and aggressive chin; by everyday standards
a plain young woman, but redeemed from
unattractiveness by an air of absorbed interest
in some vision of her own. Since leaving
school the two girls had exchanged letters of
prodigious length. Once or twice they had
visited each other’s homes, but these visits
had provided an intercourse less intimate,
less real, than that of their letters. Into the
bubbling pot of that correspondence was
poured all the raw egoism, all the shy solemn
discoveries, of two active minds passing through
the adventure of adolescence. Their knowledge
of each other at school had been a mere
passing acquaintanceship compared with this
new intimacy that only distance and the postal
service had made possible.</p>

<p>Recently they had begun to drift apart.
Aunt Hester’s disapproval of normal life made
the house at Penlington something of a prison;
Aunt Hester’s friends were anæmic, uncongenial.
‘Nothing ever happens to me,’ she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
said to herself. ‘I never meet anyone or do
anything. Things just go on, every day
alike.’ She began to indulge herself in pessimism.
Compared with the soothing syrup of
Aunt Hester’s religion, despair was almost
intoxicating: she tasted it eagerly, as though
it had been wine. In those days she and
Hypatia had echoed each other rapturously
enough, agreeing—with what delight—that
life was but a dry husk and death a fit ending
to a witless scheme. But now Hypatia, with a
fatal instinct for novelty, had subsided into the
arms of a new religion, a religion that made
summary end of all problems by denying their
existence. It was this, Sheila divined, that had
put that look of assured calm into her eyes.</p>

<p>‘So here you are then,’ said Hypatia, shy, as
ever, of demonstration. ‘Where’s your trunk?
I’ve got the trap in the station-yard.’</p>

<p>With Sheila and her belongings safely in
the trap Hypatia took the reins between her
capable fingers and drove away.</p>

<p>‘It’s very jolly here,’ said Sheila.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Much the same as before. Why,
it must be a year since your last visit!’</p>

<p>‘It is.’</p>

<p>‘Scandalous!’ Hypatia smiled reproof.
‘Well, has your quest succeeded yet?’</p>

<p>‘My quest?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>‘You wrote some months ago saying that
you could never rest until you had found a
philosophy that would hold water?’</p>

<p>‘I’m still seeking,’ admitted Sheila.</p>

<p>‘You’ll never find it,’ remarked Hypatia,
with calm certainty, ‘in the direction you are
looking in.’</p>

<p>‘No?’ said Sheila good-humouredly.</p>

<p>‘Well, you’ll have plenty of chance here of
inspecting every fad,’ said Hypatia. ‘They’re
a lively set, our neighbours. There’s almost
every shade of belief and unbelief possible to
the human mind represented here, you’ll
remember, and every shade has its club or
church or soap-box.’</p>

<p>‘Even your shade?’ interposed Sheila.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Though that’s altogether different,’
Hypatia retorted. ‘Still I can understand
that you think it just one more little sect and
nothing else. When you are in science you
will see everything more clearly.’</p>

<p>‘I shall see that there’s nothing to see at
all,’ said Sheila. ‘Isn’t that your fundamental
doctrine?’</p>

<p>‘True, matter does not exist, if that’s what
you mean,’ said Hypatia. ‘That is perhaps
Our Leader’s greatest discovery. God is All-Good,
the very Principle of Goodness, and man
is His reflection. Sin, disease, and death——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>‘Exist in the reflection but not in the
reflector,’ remarked Sheila. ‘Are your people
of the same way of thinking?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no.’ Hypatia shook her head.
‘Mother’s <i>trying</i> to understand, but Father’s
making no attempt at all.’</p>

<p>‘What about your brother?’</p>

<p>‘Of course, Edward’s hopeless. He’s
utterly absorbed in his precious book.’</p>

<p>‘I thought he was going in for law,’ said
Sheila.</p>

<p>‘So did I. So did everybody. He got a
good first in his Tripos. But he doesn’t
really care for law. History’s his great subject.’</p>

<p>‘What’s the book about?’ Sheila was
excited by the thought of meeting in the flesh
this maker of books.</p>

<p>‘I believe he calls it <i>A History of the
Religious Idea</i>, but he’s very reticent about it.
It’s a very proud exhibition of ignorance, no
doubt.’</p>

<p>‘Hypatia!’ protested Sheila. ‘How very
unkind of you!’</p>

<p>Hypatia sniffed.</p>

<p>‘Not at all. You misunderstand me. Edward,
you see, is an agnostic. <i>Tout ce que
je sais, c’est que je ne sais rien</i>, you know. He
professes to know nothing about God and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
on, and is just as proud of his ignorance as I
used to be of mine.’</p>

<p>‘It must be nice for you to know all about
it now,’ said Sheila.</p>

<p>‘It is,’ agreed the seer. ‘But it’s knowledge
anyone can share who will try to understand.’</p>

<p>From the field they were passing <i>Fairfield’s
Hygienic Corsets</i> blazed in letters of red above
the hedge. The factory chimneys blotted out
the horizon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Hypatia’s father was a spare, bullet-headed
man with mutton-chop whiskers of a sandy hue
and an indomitable nose that he had followed
faithfully <i>per aspera ad astra</i>. The stars of
Mr. Fairfield’s attainment were commercial
prosperity and for his son the education that
he himself had been denied. It became more
and more apparent to Sheila, during that drive
from the station, that for Hypatia’s parents
Edward, the firstborn, was the being round
whom the world revolved. For him the sun
shone and the little stars clapped their hands.
Fairfield senior, at first indifferent to Edward,
had been trained in son-worship by his wife.
Behind a brusqueness that passed for eccentric
humour Mrs. Fairfield concealed power.
Worshipping her son, for his advancement she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
had used her husband unsparingly, guiding his
energy consistently in the direction of most
commercial gain, and curbing his desire to
spend himself, a prophet in the wilderness, in
fruitless public advocacy of freethought. Her
subjugation of her husband, himself a being
of great though erratic energy, was the gradual
achievement of twenty-five years.</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss Dyrle,’ said Hypatia’s father
briskly. ‘Here you are again! We’re glad
to see you. You know that.’</p>

<p>He looked at Sheila kindly, but as if to say:
‘Deny it if you can.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ he added, ‘here’s my wife. The
honoured guest’s arrived, me dear, and I’m
just extending to her, in the name of the
family, a hearty welcome.’</p>

<p>The arrival of Mrs. Fairfield displaced a
lot of air.</p>

<p>‘Now this <i>is</i> a treat,’ she said, holding out
both her hands. ‘My dear Sheila! I may
still call you Sheila, mayn’t I? You are so
<i>often</i> in our thoughts!’</p>

<p>Sheila murmured her pleasure.</p>

<p>‘Must take us as you find us,’ admonished
Mr. Fairfield. ‘We’re homely folk with no
airs. No education to speak of. Couldn’t
afford it. And now that we can afford it—it’s
too late.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>‘Not too late for Edward, father dear,’
Edward’s mother reminded him.</p>

<p>‘Ah no. One scholar in the family at any
rate.’</p>

<p>‘One scholar, three agnostics, and a religious
crank, eh, dad?’ remarked Hypatia.</p>

<p>Her father laughed.</p>

<p>‘Heard the news?’ He turned to Sheila.
‘Hypatia’s saved. Got a new religion. Mine
wasn’t good enough for her.’</p>

<p>‘What is yours, dad? I didn’t know you
had one.’</p>

<p>‘When you and Edward were nippers I
told you my religion. Be afraid of nothing
except doing wrong. That’s mine. Everything
in the garden’s lovely: that’s yours.’</p>

<p>‘Well, stop arguing all of you, and come
to tea,’ said Mrs. Fairfield. ‘Sheila must be
ready for hers, I’m sure. Have you met
Bunny, Sheila?’</p>

<p>‘No. Who’s Bunny?’</p>

<p>‘One of mother’s young men,’ explained
Hypatia. ‘Quite an acquisition. Aristocratic
by birth, democratic in sentiment. Isn’t that
it, mother?’</p>

<p>At tea they were joined by Edward, rather
reluctantly, and by the Honourable Richard
Bunnard, <i>alias</i> Bunny. Bunny was a fair
freckled youth, with sleek hair brushed straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
back from his forehead and well plastered to the
head. His blue eyes followed Hypatia’s every
movement with patient doglike devotion, except
when recalled from this dereliction by the voice
of Mrs. Fairfield.</p>

<p>‘Now then, Bunny! I want to hear what
you think about this minimum wage question.
Is thirty-two shillings enough for a skilled
worker like a plate-layer?’</p>

<p>Bunny, very nervous, began opening and
shutting his mouth soundlessly like a goldfish.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mrs. Fairfield, I hardly think so.
A fellow could hardly live on such a mere
pittance, could he? Forty-two or fifty-two or
even....’</p>

<p>‘Sixty-two,’ murmured Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sixty-two,’ he said, catching eagerly
at a straw. ‘Or say three guineas, sixty-three.
Not much more than a hundred and
fifty a year, you know.’</p>

<p>‘There, father!’ cried Mrs. Fairfield.
‘What do you think of that?’</p>

<p>‘Of what, me dear?’</p>

<p>‘Why, the plate-layers are to have a minimum
of sixty-three shillings a week?’</p>

<p>Bunny laughed.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, Mrs. Fairfield. It doesn’t follow.
I only said they ought to have that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>‘Well, you must see to it,’ retorted Mrs.
Fairfield. ‘You young people, that’s your
work in life, to stir things up. I think you
must go into parliament, Bunny. Yes. I
shall send you to parliament to put things
right for us.’</p>

<p>‘But perhaps Bunny would rather not be sent
to parliament, mother?’ suggested Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘Indeed,’ said the young man, ‘I’d much
rather not. Edward would make a much
better politician than I.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield proudly surveyed her son.
‘Ah, we must see about Edward. We’re
not quite ready for parliament yet, are we,
Edward?’</p>

<p>Edward smiled. ‘For my part, I never shall
be ready.’</p>

<p>‘Mother ought to go there herself,’ said
Hypatia. ‘She’d put the world straight in ten
minutes.’</p>

<p>Her mother listened indulgently.</p>

<p>‘Do you know, Sheila, my children are
very lucky children. They’ve been brought
up in perfect freedom. They’ve got the habit
of freedom. They do and think just as they
like, have never known what compulsion was.
Here’s Hypatia now, with her religion: she’s
never been taught it by me; I’ve never forced
anything down her throat. I believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
everybody has a right to follow his own
bent.’</p>

<p>‘It must be very nice,’ said Sheila, ‘to
be brought up in an atmosphere like that.’</p>

<p>‘It would be,’ Hypatia murmured, but
Mrs. Fairfield did not take up the challenge.</p>

<p>‘I wish you’d teach me your New Thought,’
begged Bunny of Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘Which is it, New Thought or Higher
Thought?’ asked Sheila.</p>

<p>‘Neither,’ answered Edward. ‘It’s something
newer and higher than either. Unfortunately
you have to believe it implicitly
before you can understand it to be anything but
nonsense.’</p>

<p>‘You can be quiet, Edward,’ said his sister,
‘even if you can’t be just.’</p>

<p>‘But, really,’ protested the scared Bunny.
‘I am quite in earnest, Hypatia. I would
listen respectfully to anyone’s religion, especially
yours. Won’t you tell me about it?’</p>

<p>Hypatia relented. ‘I will, some time. It’s
useless with Edward about.’</p>

<p>‘It was founded by a woman,’ said Edward,
‘and she’s written a book that is the beginning
and end of all Truth. Read it, Bunny, read it
and live.’</p>

<p>‘You see.’ Hypatia smiled patiently.
‘That’s what I have to put up with.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>‘It’s too bad,’ Bunny reproached Edward.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t sympathize with me, <i>please</i>!’
said Hypatia.</p>

<p>Sheila thought: ‘How hard she has grown!’
and, having already tasted of her friend’s
sublime certainties, she felt some relish for
Edward’s mockery.</p>

<p>Edward seemed the most likeable person
in the room, except perhaps Bunny. Edward
was for the most part very quiet and self-contained.
He possessed rather an impressive
dome of forehead, but he maintained an
impenetrable reserve without assuming that air
of learning and distinction in which his mother
sought so earnestly to invest him. Mrs. Fairfield’s
maternal glance conveyed unmistakably
to the rest: ‘We must not trouble Edward
with our trivial talk. His thoughts are not
our thoughts; neither are his ways our ways.
He has taken his degree, and he is writing a
book.’ Sometimes she referred questions to
him, as to an authority; it was as though
she was continually thrusting upon him his
bachelor’s hood, he as continually repudiating
it with a confession of ignorance or indifference.
His anxiety to avoid oracular authority
kept him more silent than the rest; and this
very silence gave him in Sheila’s eyes a distinction
that was almost fascination. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
guessed him to be modest, unassuming, and
clever. The mystery of his inner life drew
her interest towards him.</p>

<p>But Bunny, too, was interesting; for Bunny
had good looks and that air of trustfully appealing
for affection to which Sheila was so susceptible.
There was something pathetic about
his obvious devotion to Hypatia. Except the
commanding Mrs. Fairfield he seemed to look
at no one else. He deferred to Hypatia
constantly.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you would say that a headache
is essentially unreal, Hypatia? If we knew
the truth about ourselves we shouldn’t have
headaches, should we?’</p>

<p>‘We shouldn’t have even heads,’ said
Edward. ‘I see you’ve already had a dose,
Bunny.’</p>

<p>‘Shut up, Fairfield!’ said the Honourable
Richard. ‘Give your sister a hearing. Am I
right, Hypatia?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ agreed Hypatia. ‘Our failure
to apprehend the truth is the root of all so-called
evil and pain.’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Bunny, wrinkling his brow.</p>

<p>Sheila was touched to see the poor boy falling
so easy a pray to the dominating Hypatia. But
Mrs. Fairfield thought it was time to look
after her property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>‘You don’t, my poor Bunny,’ cut in Mrs.
Fairfield. ‘Nor does anyone else. No sense,
anyhow. Don’t fill your mind with such
stuff just to please Hypatia.... You must
be a good boy,’ she added, ‘and do as I tell
you.’</p>

<p>‘Mother means that, Bunny,’ said Hypatia.
‘She means every word, although she tries
to make a joke of it. If you want to please
mother, obey her in all things. It is the only
way.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield became pale and distressed.
Signs of an approaching fainting-fit were
perceptible. Observing them, her husband
broke in sharply. ‘Hypatia, hold your
noise!’</p>

<p>So there was a feud, thought Sheila, between
the young woman and the old: a duel for
the soul of Bunny. Since he had apparently
no brains of his own worth considering, the
scalp would no doubt fall to Hypatia, who
had youth as an ally. And then what terrible
vengeance would fall upon him? Could nothing
save him from them both? A highly
dangerous pity awoke in Sheila’s heart.</p>

<p>‘You shall all go to the Folk Dancing
to-night,’ announced Mrs. Fairfield.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The lure of Folk Dancing led them across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
two fields to a turreted eccentric stone building
known as the Summer School, which was at
once a gigantic advertisement and a place of
mental and physical recreation for Fairfield’s
factory hands. He had spent thousands of
pounds on this long-cherished scheme, and
only a well-timed fainting-fit of his wife’s had
prevented his spending thousands more.</p>

<p>Fairfield’s Summer School was as hygienic
as his corsets. It was a curious horseshoe-shaped
building enclosing a large well-kept
lawn in the middle of which, on festive occasions,
a maypole was erected; a tower and
belfry loomed at the back. To these cloisters
the factory hands were wont to repair for free
instruction in the theory and practice of arts
and modern languages, for lectures on history,
sociology, science, for concerts and dances
on the green. It claimed to be, and was, a
local centre of liberal popular culture. Anything
and everything could be discussed there
save one thing: it was a point of honour with
the founder that Fairfield’s Hygienic Corsets
should never be mentioned.</p>

<p>Dusk had already fallen when the Fairfield
party reached the green, and the dancing had
already begun. Someone began lighting the
lamps.</p>

<p>‘This is jolly!’ said Bunny with infectious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
good spirits. ‘Won’t you dance with me,
Hypatia?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve never been taken for Hypatia before,’
Sheila answered.</p>

<p>‘Oh, sorry! It’s Miss Dyrle. Do dance
with me, Miss Dyrle. It’s a waltz this time,
without trimmings.’</p>

<p>They whirled away among the dancers.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know these old dances, do
you?’</p>

<p>‘No. But what does it matter? They
stick in a few ordinary things now and again
specially for Philistines like us.’</p>

<p>Her heart danced with the music.</p>

<p>‘You brought your violin, didn’t you, Mr.
Bunnard? When are you going to play for
us?’</p>

<p>But Bunny did not answer. Sheila was
rather chilled to observe his abrupt change of
mood. He had caught sight of Hypatia
dancing with her brother.</p>

<p>They finished the set in silence, and Sheila
was immediately claimed by Edward. She felt
bitterly alone in the world. She and Hypatia
had come to a definite parting of the ways;
and she had no other friend.</p>

<p>After a few moments she complained to
Edward of giddiness. He led her to a seat.</p>

<p>‘Feel better now?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>‘Quite, thanks. But I’d rather not begin
again just yet.’</p>

<p>He studied the ground.</p>

<p>‘It’s a year since you were here.’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve often thought of that visit.’</p>

<p>‘Have you?’ said Sheila. ‘I live with
my aunt, you know, and she doesn’t approve
of my visits to a home of free-thinkers.’</p>

<p>‘But you are not of her persuasion?’</p>

<p>‘Obviously not. Hypatia was my best
friend.’</p>

<p>‘Was?’</p>

<p>He seemed to be offering a far from unwelcome
sympathy.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I’m afraid so. I wouldn’t have you
tell her for the world. But we’ve drifted away
from each other.’</p>

<p>‘Yes? I fancied so.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose it’s this religion of hers,’ said
Sheila. ‘Of course I don’t care a rap what
she believes, but she’s grown so ... so
remote.’</p>

<p>‘I agree with you entirely. I’m glad she
hasn’t converted <i>you</i> anyhow. My friend
Bunny is doomed, I fear. Hypatia begs the
whole question. If matter is only an appearance
it is none the less real to our minds:
it exists mentally. The whole philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
is nothing but a silly quibble about terms.’</p>

<p>‘How is your book getting on?’ asked
Sheila.</p>

<p>‘Slowly, but it <i>is</i> getting on. Writing a
hundred thousand words is a great labour.
The mere pen-pushing alone is a bore.’</p>

<p>‘It must be. Couldn’t you dictate it?’</p>

<p>‘That would be difficult for me and very
dull for the unfortunate secretary. I’m afraid
I should be too self-conscious to work well.’</p>

<p>‘At first, perhaps,’ said Sheila. ‘But that
would wear off. And it would be a privilege
for the secretary, I should think.’</p>

<p>‘A privilege!’ He laughed. ‘Why, the
book is scandalous and atheistical.’</p>

<p>‘That’s why to help would be a privilege,’
she answered with a nervous smile. ‘Would
it really help you to be able to dictate to
someone?’</p>

<p>‘That would depend, I expect.’</p>

<p>She summoned her courage.</p>

<p>‘Well, to me, for instance?’</p>

<p>‘<i>You!</i>’</p>

<p>‘Yes, me,’ she said humbly. ‘I <i>can</i> spell,
you know.’</p>

<p>‘You would do that for me?’ he exclaimed
in amazement.</p>

<p>‘I’d willingly do it—for the cause,’ she
added rather mischievously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>‘How astoundingly decent of you!’</p>

<p>‘It’s not very polite to be so surprised
to find me decent,’ she said, laughing at
him.</p>

<p>He looked with undisguised admiration into
her Irish eyes. ‘By Jove, what things we
could do together!’</p>

<p>A flame of comradeship leaped to life in
Sheila. The word ‘together’ made an echoing
music in her mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Fairfield stood before them.</p>

<p>‘Miss Dyrle, give me the honour. A real
old-fashioned dance this time instead of these
new-fangled folk things. Sir Roger de Coverley.
And after that Bunny’s going to give us a
tune on the fiddle.’</p>

<p>Later, feeling rather breathless and crumpled,
she listened to Bunny’s ‘tune on the fiddle.’
She could see the violinist’s face, with a new
expression in his eyes, spangled grotesquely
with a red light from a fairy lamp. The moon
was rising in a pale green sky. Two tall
feathery trees, swaying in the gentle wind,
seemed to caress each other as they merged for
a moment and drew apart again. The music
spoke—spoke to Sheila intimately. It seemed
to have for her a secret message. It communicated
a tremulous half-sobbing ecstasy of
pain and beauty: it drew her, shuddering with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
delight, through divers moods. Now she was
in a moonlit forest of tall poplars, walking,
walking, alone in the universe. Now there
was a flowered field, full of white and green,
yellow and red, made glad with the twinkling
feet of dancing shepherds and shepherdesses.</p>

<p>As if in response to the music, stars began
tremblingly to peer through the luminous green
curtain of the sky.</p>

<p>The next morning Edward invited her into
the holy of holies where the book was being
written.</p>

<p>It was a small room having some of the
austerity of a monk’s cell. Two of the walls
were lined with books, classified under such
headings as Ancient History, Mediæval History,
Modern History, Sociology, Science,
Philosophy.</p>

<p>‘I do everything on a system,’ remarked
Edward in a rather satisfied tone; but Sheila
only laughed at his labels.</p>

<p>‘I could never read here,’ she said. ‘I
should put a ticket on myself and stand in
the corner all day. What a dreadfully orderly
room!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you like it?’ There was disappointment
in his tone.</p>

<p>‘Yes, very much. It is little and quiet
and studious. There’s no cabbage pattern on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the wall and no Jorrocks pictures. There are
no pictures of podgy children stroking big
dogs, and no family photographs.... I’m
sure that gentleman over there isn’t in the
family.’ She pointed to a photograph of a
Greek statue.</p>

<p>‘No, that’s Euripides. And yet there’s
something about the room that you don’t like.
What is it?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you do everything on a system, you
said. I think that’s what’s wrong. You’ve
done this room on a system. <i>Ars est celare
artem.</i> Isn’t it the same with systems?’</p>

<p>‘Do you read Horace much?’ he enquired.</p>

<p>‘Not at all,’ confessed Sheila. ‘I found
that tag at the end of a dictionary.’</p>

<p>He laughed. ‘You’re delightfully honest.’</p>

<p>A shaft of sunlight falling on his face made
visible the little downy hairs over his cheekbones.
Sheila caught her eyes involuntarily
looking at them.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said. ‘Aren’t you going to
work now?’</p>

<p>‘There’s no hurry.’</p>

<p>‘Come, come, I’m sure your system doesn’t
permit loitering! Can you provide me with
pen and paper?’</p>

<p>‘Do you really mean me to dictate to you?’</p>

<p>She felt a sudden twinge of embarrassment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
lest she was pressing unwanted assistance upon
him.</p>

<p>‘You said I was honest just now. Will you
be equally honest with me? If my presence
would disturb you, please turn me out.’</p>

<p>He considered gravely for a moment. ‘One
can hardly tell—save by experiment.’</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t mind telling me, would
you?’</p>

<p>‘No. I would tell you at once. You have
sense enough not to be offended.’</p>

<p>She was absurdly elated by this curt
compliment.</p>

<p>‘Besides,’ he added, ‘the book comes
first with me always. Nothing else matters.’</p>

<p>She ruminated upon that thought for several
seconds. The bluntness, the ungraciousness
of it at once repelled and attracted her. She
could not but admire Edward’s capacity for
impersonal enthusiasm; it made him great;
and she found something fascinating in his
indifference to lesser things. Among those
lesser things she was content, for the moment,
to include herself. To be his tool, to help him
in his work: such service, she felt, would be its
own sufficient reward.</p>

<p>Noting her silence, ‘That seems to you
inhuman?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘It seems to me superhuman,’ answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Sheila. ‘Perhaps that’s the secret of fine
living: to subordinate all personal things to
some great impersonal passion.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just how I feel,’ he said.</p>

<p>Sheila continued. ‘Unless we’re content to
be miserable and useless, we must have a
consuming passion, if it’s only for collecting
beetles: something that doesn’t depend on
anybody else.... Persons change,’ she
added sadly.</p>

<p>‘You’re thinking of Hypatia,’ he suggested.</p>

<p>‘Hypatia, yes. And someone else. It’s
like building your house on sand, you know,
ever to rely on persons.’</p>

<p>‘Still,’ said Edward, ‘if a person’s rational
and consistent—and there <i>are</i> consistent persons.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and there are clockwork toys. A
perfectly consistent person must be very much
like them, I should think.’</p>

<p>‘But surely you agree that man <i>is</i> just that:
a mechanical toy in the hands of Necessity.
The illusion of freewill is only disguised
mechanism.’</p>

<p>‘How dreadful!’ Sheila exclaimed. ‘Then
Henley’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I am the master of my fate;</div>
<div class="verse">I am the captain of my soul—</div>
</div></div>

<p>are meaningless to you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>‘The man who thinks that he is master of
his fate is the most enslaved of all persons,’
said Edward. ‘For he is not even master of the
facts.’</p>

<p>‘That’s a quotation from your book, I
believe,’ said Sheila. And the young man
blushed.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a long and
animated discussion, the first of many. In
Edward Sheila discovered that reliability which
she had thought could be attributed to no
person. His mind was keen and critical: it
worked with a certain deadly precision that
was as impressive and at times almost as terrifying
as a piece of gigantic machinery. He had
doubts and hesitancies indeed: the hesitancies
of one aware of the subtleties, the baffling
complexity, of problems which less careful
minds deemed simple; but once he had
reached a definite decision, nothing short of
overpowering ratiocination, no consideration
of comfort or sentiment, could shake him from
it. And while her sense of poetry revolted
against a certain aridness in his philosophy, the
very magnitude and the shattering presumption
of his attempt to rationalize the universe
overpowered her imagination and thrilled her
with a sense of great adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span></p>

<h4>4</h4>

<p>In sharp contrast with this austere enthusiasm
for Edward Fairfield and his work, there
flickered up in her heart a secret romantic
compassion for the Honourable Richard Bunnard,
that fair-haired, frank-eyed, simple-minded
young man, whose nickname, Bunny,
appeared even to the eye of affection so entirely
suitable. For his youth and good nature, for
his docility, for the irresponsible levity that
even the Fairfield atmosphere could not entirely
inhibit, and still more for the less definite
charm he unconsciously exercised over her,
Sheila conceived a liking that trembled sometimes
dangerously on the verge of tenderness.
She was stirred by his voluntary surrender of
his personality into the grasping hands of
Hypatia, the high-priestess of a new oracle,
and trembled at the thought of his being
immolated, a blood sacrifice, upon that godless
altar. But, most of all, the memory of his music
troubled the deep cool waters of her mind. She
sought in him often, and sometimes for a
fleeting instant found, the transfigured face
of the violinist who had once laid his spell upon
her.</p>

<p>She swayed for a while between these two
magnetic points: Edward’s intellectuality and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
Bunny’s manifest need for being looked after;
but if the one’s self-sufficiency sometimes
repelled her the other’s comparative vacuity
of mind no less tried her patience. With
such an alternative, perhaps her womanhood
would have urged her irresistibly towards
Bunny, in spite of discouraging precedent, had
not that youth remained unaware of her claim
to be anything more exciting (and that was
exciting enough, no doubt) than Hypatia’s
friend.</p>

<p>‘If only he had Edward’s brains as well as
his own niceness,’ Sheila said to herself; and
humour compelled her to add, self-scornfully:
‘Well, what if he had? He’d perhaps be
even more indifferent to me than he is now.’
And that would have been hard; for his
absorption in Hypatia was so complete that he
could even sing her praises in little solitary
interviews with Sheila contrived for that very
purpose.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think she’s very clever?’ he
said one day, incredulous of a hint of criticism.</p>

<p>‘I know she’s got wonderful brains,’ Sheila
assured him. ‘But at present I believe they’re
under a cloud. That sounds horribly dogmatic,
I expect. But I really think Hypatia’s a little
bit of a fanatic nowadays.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>He rebelled against that. ‘She’s an enthusiast,
if you like.’</p>

<p>Sheila smiled. ‘Perhaps that’s all. I suppose
fanaticism’s only the name we give to
the other person’s enthusiasm.’</p>

<p>‘I must say she often puzzles me,’ admitted
Bunny. ‘You know her very well, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Not so well as you do, I expect.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but you were at school with her,’ he
urged.</p>

<p>‘That’s five, six, seven years ago.’</p>

<p>‘Still....’ He ached to believe that
Sheila out of the fulness of her knowledge of
Hypatia could help him. ‘Do you think she’s
capable of liking anybody?’</p>

<p>‘Liking?’ The clear inadequacy of the
word arrested her.</p>

<p>‘Liking very much, I mean, don’t you see?
It’s this way: supposing you wanted....’
He waited as if for her to help him out. But
she rather pointedly didn’t. ‘She seems so
aloof very often, don’t you think?’</p>

<p>To this mild proposition Sheila assented.
‘A little cold, you think, perhaps?’ She
guided his stumbling feet thus far.</p>

<p>‘Cold, but not,’ he hoped, ‘incapable of—well,
affection, as it were.’</p>

<p>Sheila agreed gravely that ‘incapable’ would
be too absolute a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>‘She is very fine-looking.’ He had the
air of submitting this idea for her acceptation.</p>

<p>‘Fine is quite the right epithet,’ Sheila
assured this incredible youth. ‘She has always
been fearless; you can see that in her face.
And she had a sense of humour once.’ To
herself she added: ‘Am I so very maternal
that he must confide in me?’</p>

<p>After a brief transitional hovering, when he
was neither quite in Sheila’s company nor
definitely out of it, he went away, no doubt
to treasure all these things in his heart, leaving
Sheila in a state that oscillated between amusement
and a half-ashamed regret. And that
night Hypatia, joining her friend in the spacious
bedroom that they shared, displayed unwonted
animation. Whether it was Bunny or the
stirring in its sleep of old friendship that
loosened her tongue, Sheila patiently waited to
have revealed to her.</p>

<p>Hypatia was in a reminiscential mood. She
sat on Sheila’s bed and talked of Selborne days,
of feuds with Miss Fry, of Sheila’s Aunt Hester,
and of what little she knew of Kay. She
appeared rather to dwell on Kay. She called
up once-familiar faces from the pit of oblivion
and set them again speaking forgotten parts.
And presently, without preamble, she remarked:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
‘There’s more in Bunny than he allows to
appear, don’t you think?’</p>

<p>‘Very likely,’ Sheila said, sleepily. ‘But
you know him so much better than I.’</p>

<p>‘He’s ductile,’ said Hypatia, rather consciously
selecting the word.</p>

<p>‘Too much so,’ Sheila ventured. ‘How
beautifully he plays the violin. That night at
the Folk Dancing he was wonderful.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. In his way he’s quite a genius.
Though of course this musical glamour is not
really healthy. It’s a kind of delusion, a
magnetism. In Real Knowledge it doesn’t
exist.’</p>

<p>‘He’s rather marvellous, your friend Bunny,’
Sheila said tritely, chilled by Hypatia’s eternal
prosing.</p>

<p>‘He’s a very nice boy. But under
mother’s thumb at present. I shall change
that.’</p>

<p>Sheila shivered. ‘You! How?’</p>

<p>‘He proposed to me to-night.’</p>

<p>Sheila was dumbstruck for a moment. Then,
‘You’re very calm about it,’ she said. ‘Did
you...?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet. But if I do accept him there’ll
be a fine tussle with mother.’</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t your mother like him?’</p>

<p>‘Immensely. But mother has an inordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
appetite for affection. She’s like a spider with
a fly. She won’t share him.’</p>

<p>‘How bitterly you speak!’</p>

<p>Hypatia loftily repudiated the suggestion.
‘Not at all. I’m merely stating a fact. You
will see, if you’re here long enough.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Bunny!’ said Sheila.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t worry about him. I shan’t let
mother gobble him up, you may be sure.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you won’t,’ Sheila replied, biting
her lip. ‘You’ll marry him sooner than that.’</p>

<p>But irony was lost on Hypatia. ‘Mother
shan’t have him,’ she reiterated.</p>

<h4>5</h4>

<p>Edward found the presence of another person
distracting. The dictation of his book was
soon abandoned, and he pursued his solitary
way. Yet not solitary, for he was not unconscious
that his solitude had been invaded,
destroyed; and he was not yet sure whether
he liked or resented the invasion. In spirit
another walked by his side. For Sheila this
book, child of his brain, became a living thing
to be thought about with a reverent excitement.
She was still enough of a child to find
this making of books miraculous: it was like
that creation of something out of nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
which the church attributed to God. The
best of Edward went into his book, and Sheila
was quick to remember this in his defence
when vitality or humour seemed lacking in
him. He worked with clocklike regularity.
He wrote from nine till twelve-thirty. He
resumed work, after lunch, at one-thirty and
wrote till, at half-past four, some toast and tea
was brought to him on a tray. For this
refreshment he allowed himself twenty minutes,
and for ten minutes he systematically did nothing.
From five till seven was his final daily
spell.</p>

<p>Seven o’clock released him from his self-imposed
task. At half-past seven he dined
with his family, and having dined was free to
cultivate such social amenities as he did not
utterly despise. He formed the habit of seeking
out Sheila; he persuaded her to go for
walks with him: strenuous almost racing
walks, conscientious and concentrated exercise,
essential to the maintenance of physical and
therefore mental fitness. She, glad of an
antidote for the daily dose of omniscience forced
down her throat by Hypatia, welcomed this
new friendship. She was a willing and intelligent
listener; the quickness of her mind
delighted him, and his appreciation evoked an
answering delight in her. The variety and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
colour of her thinking, a habit she had of
investing with emotion even the dry bones of
argument, provided a foil for Edward’s exact
logic. She took imaginative leaps in metaphysical
speculation, while he plodded laboriously
on from point to point, never retracing a
step. They sharpened their wits against each
other and felt marvellously stimulated by the
process. And still it was of the book, and of
cognate subjects, that he talked, in an unending
torrent of discourse. He involved himself in
sentences so prodigious that Sheila sometimes
got lost in a labyrinth of phrases and subordinate
clauses. More than once she felt rising in
her a secret impatience; she even got to the
point of contemplating the discontinuance of
an intercourse that became daily more overpowering.
Yet looking back, as the days
passed, upon that vista of intimate, flushed,
excited talk, she could not find heart to cut
adrift from him; moreover, he had made her
feel, not without a sense of her presumption,
that she had somehow become necessary to his
literary scheme. These enormously distended
monologues of his helped him to clarify his
thought, and her occasional interpolated criticism
freshened his dialectic processes. She
felt a certain responsibility for him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield observed this ripening intimacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
with a curious admixture of benevolence and
displeasure. One evening she came upon her
son and Sheila sauntering in the garden together
a few minutes before seven, and smiled at her
guest with an inimical glint in her eye.</p>

<p>‘Sheila dear,’ she said bitter-sweetly, ‘you
mustn’t take my son from his work.’</p>

<p>Sheila, flushing with resentment, could make
no reply.</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ said Edward, neither hotly nor
coldly, ‘you interrupt the thread of my argument.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield flashed a point of jealous fire
at Sheila, who turned on her heel, biting her
lips in vexation. She was astounded and
ashamed by this momentary and involuntary
revelation of a woman’s soul.</p>

<p>Edward followed her without an instant’s
hesitation.</p>

<p>‘See you at dinner, mother,’ he said casually,
over his shoulder.... ‘The matter is not
quite so simple as that,’ he went on, speaking
to the girl at his side. ‘The vitalist hypothesis
has implications that lie deeper than that altogether,
and that run, in my opinion, altogether
counter to the ascertained facts of experience.
Chemical analysis....’</p>

<p>Sheila let him ramble on, grateful that he
took no notice of her evident embarrassment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
She wished he had left her. She wanted to
escape from the intolerable sense of having been
delivered an insulting ultimatum, a warning, by
Edward’s detestable mother. Yes, Edward’s
detestable mother: that was how she thought
of the woman in whose mien she had read
‘Hands off my property!’ Her instinct was
to run away from the house and never return;
but slowly, as Edward’s sentences gathered
length and momentum, she came to regard
such an action as merely melodramatic.</p>

<p>She cut one of his clauses in half by asking
abruptly: ‘What did your mother mean by
that?’</p>

<p>He was pulled up short, and left floundering.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon?’</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry,’ said Sheila; ‘I’m very rude.
I’m afraid I wasn’t listening. I was thinking
of what your mother said. What makes her
hate me so?’</p>

<p>‘Hate you! Dear me, no!’ he exclaimed.
‘You’re too sensitive. Mother is hurt because
I give my confidence to you and not to her.
Don’t worry about her. She’ll have to get
used to it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, she won’t. I am going home to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘To-morrow?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>‘I had already arranged to, you know,’
Sheila untruthfully assured him.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will stay longer,’ he said earnestly.
‘If mother has offended you she shall
apologize. I’ll see to it.’</p>

<p>‘Pray do nothing of the kind. And let’s
drop the subject.... Won’t you forgive
my inattention and tell me what you were
saying?’</p>

<p>They had by now reached a remote part of
the garden, a part from which the house was
hidden by a mass of sweet peas clustering over
trelliswork. A rustic seat on the gravel path
by the trim croquet-lawn invited them to rest.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ he said, when they had sat
down. ‘I’ve finished the <i>magnum opus</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Finished!’ she exclaimed, glowing with
excited pleasure. ‘How fine! Aren’t you
tremendously glad?’</p>

<p>‘It’s a relief,’ he admitted. ‘I shall take a
week’s rest and then start the revision.’</p>

<p>She, exulting still in the accomplished work,
could spare no thought for the revision.</p>

<p>‘How jolly to have finished! You didn’t
tell me you were near the end?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you’d forgotten then.’ He smiled
indulgently. ‘I told you a fortnight ago that
I should finish on the thirteenth of this month.’</p>

<p>She was suitably astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>‘You mean to say you knew to a day?’</p>

<p>‘I work on a programme, you see,’ he said,
relishing her surprised admiration.</p>

<p>Now that the work was done he seemed to
have time for human weaknesses. This unexpected
boyish vanity made Sheila like him
more than she had ever done before.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you’re pleased with yourself
now!’ she mocked him gently.</p>

<p>‘Very!’ he confessed. They both laughed.</p>

<p>‘There was another thing that might have
told you,’ he said. ‘I came out of my room
before seven o’clock to-night. Have you ever
known that happen before?’</p>

<p>‘You see, my watch had stopped,’ she
explained. ‘So that is what your mother——’</p>

<p>‘Probably.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t you explain to her?’ she asked
him.</p>

<p>‘I refuse to propitiate her,’ he said. ‘Besides,
I wanted you to know first.’</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>‘Sheila,’ he said gently, ‘we could do
such a lot together!’</p>

<p>She began to rise from her seat, but he
placed on her knee a strong and strangely
reassuring hand.</p>

<p>‘It’s a year since your last visit to us, isn’t
it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Sheila found her voice, a very small voice
now, and answered ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Well, a year ago I made up my mind to
ask you to marry me. Will you?’</p>

<p>There was a teeming silence. Sheila’s mind
was in a whirl. There seemed something
wanting in the richness of this moment, a
disconcerting gap in the happiness that had
come within her reach. But another feeling
conquered. She looked at him with her heart
in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘If I can help you.... Oh, Edward, I <i>do</i>
want to help you!’</p>

<p>‘My dear!’ he said. He kissed her cheek
in warm brotherly fashion. ‘We shall be very
happy together, you and I.’ He took her
hand in his.</p>

<p>For a moment they contemplated this prospective
happiness without speaking. The
gong summoned them to dinner.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sheila accompanied Edward into the house
with a numbed feeling in one corner of her
mind. She could not banish a vague half-formed
doubt that had crept into the heart of
her new happiness. There was so much that
was fine, so much that was bracing, about her
relationship with Edward, and she told herself
that this lurking discontent was mere perversity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
A feeling of comradeliness struggled with a
sense of chill. She was to be his friend, his
wife, the partner of his life’s work; they were
intellectually in tune: what more could she
ask of life? What was this secret craving for
tenderness, for romance, but a foolish lapse
into the sentimental dreaming of her school-days?
Edward offered her in abundance what
that boy-lover Kay Wilton had been so conspicuously
unable to offer: the sympathy of
an alert mind. Sympathy and comradeship—were
not these the fairest flowers of life? The
rest were gaudy hothouse plants, nurtured in
an artificial warmth and unable to endure
the healthy rigours of continual daily intimacy.</p>

<p>She tried by such reflections to still the
whispering voice within her; nevertheless she
was not herself during dinner, and it was with
a catch of the breath, afterwards, that she
heard Edward announce their betrothal to his
parents. Stated coldly, the compact had the
terrifying air of something irrevocable. She
controlled with effort an impulse to flee from
the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield was exclamatory and encouraging,
and Mr. Fairfield vaguely echoed his wife’s
expressions of pleasure. Mrs. Fairfield opened
her plump arms and wrapped them round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Sheila as though taking permanent possession
of her.</p>

<p>‘My dear Sheila!’ she exclaimed. ‘A new
daughter for me!’</p>

<p>From that capacious and efficient embrace
Sheila emerged with a sense of having been
rescued from a yawning gulf. The one thought
in her mind was that she did not wish to be
a daughter to Mrs. Fairfield. She felt that
Edward’s mother would as readily take, if she
could, the globe itself into that large embrace,
and exult greedily in her newly-acquired property,
like a child with a big ball that it may
bounce to its heart’s content.</p>

<p>‘Now that <i>is</i> nice!’ said Mr. Fairfield. ‘Very
pleasant arrangement indeed! Well, well!’</p>

<p>A diversion was created by the entry of
Bunny. He tried to conceal an air of desperate
purpose under the affectation of breeziness.</p>

<p>‘Hullo, by Jove!’ he exclaimed. ‘How
are you, Mrs. Fairfield? How are you, sir?
How do, Ted? And how are you, Miss
Dyrle? Myself, I’m jolly fine. Thanks for
kind inquiries.’</p>

<p>‘That’s a comfort anyhow,’ said Mrs. Fairfield
grimly. ‘You seem a little upset.’</p>

<p>‘Upset! Me!’ cried Bunny. He calmed
a little to add: ‘Bit excited perhaps. Got
some news for you, Mrs. Fairfield.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>‘Ha!’ The light of triumph gleamed in
Mrs. Fairfield’s eye. ‘You’ve agreed to be
president of the Workers’ Federation after all.’</p>

<p>‘No, not exactly.’</p>

<p>‘You haven’t!’ Mrs. Fairfield became the
picture of righteous indignation. ‘You refuse
to do a little thing like that for me, when your
name would be so valuable to us!’</p>

<p>‘It wouldn’t be fair to my father. He’s a
bit old-fashioned, I dare say, but there it is.
He can’t help being an earl. He makes
rather a point of my not getting too deep in
the movement.’</p>

<p>The Honourable Richard Bunnard stood on
one toe and twirled once round to assure every
one that he was perfectly at ease.</p>

<p>‘Please don’t fidget, Bunny, when you’re
talking to me, even though I <i>am</i> only an old
woman. Once again I ask you, and for the
last time: will you do the right thing, the
public-spirited thing?’</p>

<p>Bunny tried to soothe the exasperated lady.</p>

<p>‘My dear Mrs. Fairfield, I’ve already promised
my father.’</p>

<p>The storm burst.</p>

<p>‘Your father! Fiddlesticks your father!
Hypatia’s at the bottom of this!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t get excited, mother,’ urged Edward.</p>

<p>‘I will, I will,’ retorted his mother. ‘I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
a perfect right to get excited. You young
people, you’ve got hearts of stone. All the
love we mothers lavish on you is nothing to
you. Do we get any gratitude? Not a bit!
<i>Scorn</i>, yes, plenty of it! Scorn of our grey
hairs and our silly ways and our ignorance.
But gratitude—the last thing in the world....
Some chit of a girl comes....’</p>

<p>Edward shrugged his shoulders in cold
disgust.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ exclaimed Mrs. Fairfield. There
was an ominous pause. Her husband rushed
towards her.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right, me dear. I’ve got you safe
and sound. Sit down and have a bit of a rest.’</p>

<p>The afflicted lady sighed.</p>

<p>‘She’s going to faint,’ cried Mr. Fairfield.
‘Why didn’t you let her have her way, you
young devils, you!’</p>

<p>‘Of course she’s going to faint,’ said Edward.
‘That is the last scene of the melodrama.’</p>

<p>Sheila watched the scene with a mixture of
indignation and compassion. The indignation
was short-lived: it died suddenly at sight of
Edward’s complete detachment. He seemed
utterly devoid of the filial sentiment that would
have made allowances for his mother. For she
was, after all, his mother, Sheila reflected.
She had faced death to bring him into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
world. He was flesh of her flesh, bone of her
bone: for him she had spent herself, and he
was still the centre of her life. Had Edward
shewn anger, Sheila would have been wholeheartedly
with him, but this cold disdain, this
resolute refusal to be stirred a hair’s breadth
either to pity or to wrath seemed to Sheila’s
warmer heart almost inhuman, although it
extorted from her an unwilling admiration.</p>

<p>‘I think I’d better clear out,’ said Bunny,
moving towards the door. ‘Sorry to have
been the cause of a disturbance.’</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fairfield’s recovery was as abrupt
as her collapse had been. From the arm-chair
into which her husband had placed her she
urged the young man to stay.</p>

<p>‘Don’t go, Bunny. I’m better now. It
was my son upset me, not you. Come and
tell me your news?’</p>

<p>She spoke in a languid faded tone, the tone
of one bearing bravely an immense burden of
wrongs.</p>

<p>‘Well ...’ began Bunny nervously, glancing
towards Sheila.</p>

<p>Edward, intercepting the glance, asked:
‘Are we <i>de trop</i>, Bunny?’</p>

<p>Mr. Fairfield intervened. ‘Edward and
Miss Dyrle have just come to an understanding,
Bunny.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>‘An understanding?’ asked Bunny.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Bit of sweethearting, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Really!’ cried Bunny, beaming. ‘I congratulate
you. Well, that makes it easier for
me. There’ll be a double event.’</p>

<p>‘A what?’ demanded Mrs. Fairfield, all
the languor gone from her.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ Bunny explained, ‘I’m engaged
to be married.’</p>

<p>‘Well I declare!’ said Mr. Fairfield.
‘Engaged! Why, everybody’s getting engaged.
Time we set about it, mother,
eh?’</p>

<p>Edward made a congratulatory noise. Only
Mrs. Fairfield was silent, watching Bunny with
feline intentness.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said sharply. ‘Who’s the young
lady, Bunny?’</p>

<p>Bunny, with his hands in his pockets agitating
a bunch of keys, stood first on one leg
and then on the other.</p>

<p>‘That was what I came for,’ he said, blushing,
‘to ask your blessing, don’t you know.
You see, Hypatia....’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Fairfield curtly. ‘What
about Hypatia?’</p>

<p>Even the amiable Bunny had not unlimited
patience.</p>

<p>‘Hypatia?’ he said. ‘Well, nothing about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
her. You asked me who was the young lady.
I’ve told you.’</p>

<p>‘Hypatia!’ demanded Mrs. Fairfield.</p>

<p>‘Exactly,’ answered Bunny, and strode out
of the room.</p>

<p>‘Herbert!’ cried Mrs. Fairfield to her
husband. ‘Go after him. At once. Hypatia
shan’t have him. She shan’t!’</p>

<p>‘You’d better faint again, mother,’ remarked
Edward.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Edward, how can you!’ cried Sheila,
stung to speech.</p>

<p>She beckoned him to the bay window, as
Mrs. Fairfield followed her husband to the
door.</p>

<p>‘Edward,’ Sheila said, ‘are you sure you
want me?’</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise. ‘You know
I do.’</p>

<p>Sheila felt that her question needed an
apology. ‘It’s only that I hate to cause a
fuss. Your mother does loathe me, I’m sure.’</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his for a moment.
‘Sheila, you’re not going to forsake me, are
you?’</p>

<p>‘Not ... if you really care,’ she answered
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield from the passage stepped back
into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>‘Children!’ she muttered, regarding the
lovers with malevolence, ‘children ... no,
vipers!’</p>

<p>Her husband returned, followed by Bunny
wrapped in his dignity and by Hypatia armed
with invincible placidity.</p>

<p>‘Now understand this,’ began Mrs. Fairfield.
‘We old folk refuse to be ignored. We
just won’t put up with this insulting behaviour.
You think we don’t count, but we’ll see.
Bunny, let’s hear no more of this nonsense
about marrying Hypatia. You shall not marry
her. You’re a young snob. And Sheila
shan’t marry my Edward either. I won’t be
robbed of my children by young stuck-up
creatures who despise me and my husband
because we’re in trade.’</p>

<p>‘What a wicked lie!’ exclaimed Sheila,
with flashing eyes. ‘You know we don’t
despise you! Everybody’s parents are in
trade ... except Bunny’s, I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Herbert!... Edward! Will you stand
here and hear this girl call your mother a
wicked liar?’</p>

<p>‘Where do you want me to stand?’ enquired
Edward. ‘Besides, I’m not Sheila’s controller.
I’m not even her parent.’</p>

<p>‘You will leave my son alone,’ said Mrs.
Fairfield, struggling with her rising passion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
‘Marry the Honourable Richard, if you want
to marry.’</p>

<p>‘But that would still leave Edward and
Hypatia unmarried,’ objected Bunny, lapsing
into weak humour. ‘They can’t marry each
other, you know.’</p>

<p>‘And you leave Hypatia alone!’ Hypatia’s
mother turned upon Bunny. ‘I’ll make father
disinherit them both if they disobey me.’</p>

<p>‘Is that all you have to say, mother?’ asked
Hypatia, with the patient smile of the Christian
Scientist.</p>

<p>‘No, it is <i>not</i>....’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s quite enough,’ Hypatia assured
her. ‘Come along, Bunny. Come and buy
the licence.’</p>

<p>Without a word, the young man followed
Hypatia out of the room.</p>

<p>The flame of battle was awake now in
Sheila’s heart, burning away all lingering reluctance,
all doubts and fears. If there was to
be a feud, there was no doubt upon which
side she would fight. Age had declared war
upon Youth, and all the spirit in her woke
to the challenge. Edward, her comrade, was
being threatened with disinheritance. Sheila
knew now that she was irrevocably his: a hint
of doubt would have been shameful treason.
She forgot the cold formality of his attitude to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
his mother: she remembered only his strength,
his glorious unyielding strength.</p>

<p>‘Look here, mother,’ Edward was saying,
‘you’ll have to readjust your ideas a little.’
He waved aside a hysterical interruption.
‘No, it’s no use indulging in heroics: your
storming only makes me tired. Storm in a
teacup, that’s all. Listen to me.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield turned her back on him.</p>

<p>‘Yes, listen like that, if you wish. It’s
extraordinarily rude, but never mind. I was
saying that you’ve got to readjust your ideas a
little. They’re about a hundred years behind
the times. We young people, as you call us,
have as much right to live as you, and as much
right to freedom.’</p>

<p>His mother wheeled round swiftly. ‘Freedom!
You’ve had too much freedom!’</p>

<p>‘Please don’t interrupt,’ said Edward.
‘There’s been quite enough shouting and
stamping. I want you to reason the thing out
calmly. Freedom consists in being left alone,
left with room to grow, not in being penned
round with affection and told every minute of
the day that of course we can do as we like
if we don’t love mother and father.’</p>

<p>‘You’re hitting too hard,’ whispered Sheila.</p>

<p>‘You think,’ Edward continued, ‘because
you’ve born and bred us and sacrificed yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
for us that Hypatia and I belong to
you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, you don’t belong to me,’ said Mrs.
Fairfield in fierce sarcasm. ‘I’m only your
mother: that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘Precisely,’ said Edward. ‘Our mother,
not our owner. We belong to nobody. We
have our separate lives to live, and we intend
to live them in our own way.’</p>

<p>‘You’re mine, mine, mine!’ protested his
mother. ‘Don’t you feel any common gratitude
for what I’ve done for you? I gave you
life; I fed you with my body; and now—is
this the end?’</p>

<p>‘Those are services that cannot be repaid,’
he answered, without any trace of emotion.
‘If in return for what you did for me I had
to submit to be your doll for ever, it were
better that I had not been born at all.’</p>

<p>‘Brutal, brutal!’ interjected his father,
waking from a spell of bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ conceded Edward, ‘but it’s
nature. Nature is brutal. Do you think that
because you gave me life, as you say, that you
have the right to take it away, or smother it,
or confine it, at your pleasure? You shut
your eyes to logical inference. See to what
absurd conclusions your wild unreasoning
would lead you if you dared follow it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
end. Time and again civilization has been
hindered in its march....’</p>

<p>For a moment Sheila ceased her loyal silent
applause to ask herself: Why does Edward
talk like a parliamentary candidate? But Mrs.
Fairfield quickly distracted her attention from
that question.</p>

<p>‘I see,’ she said, ‘I’m nothing to you. I’m
only your mother. This bit of a girl, who’s
done nothing for you, whom you’ve known
ten minutes, is more to you than your mother
is.’</p>

<p>Edward assented gravely. ‘So much more
than I propose to live with her and not with
you. You were a bit of a girl yourself once,
mother. If father had been more devoted to
<i>his</i> mother than to you, you might have been
a childless spinster at this moment.’</p>

<p>‘Now then,’ said Mr. Fairfield, briskly
asserting himself. ‘We’ve had about enough
of this. Mother’s had her say. And you’ve
had yours. You’ve got the gift of the gab
all right. Now just you cut along and leave
your mother alone.’</p>

<p>‘Herbert, he shan’t have a penny of your
money!’ Mrs. Fairfield turned confidently
to her husband for ratification of this threat.
‘Tell him so.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll see. We’ll see. I’m not dead yet,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
said the little man, with unwonted independence.
‘I hadn’t any pennies myself when I
was his age.’</p>

<p>His wife turned upon him a terrible <i>Et
tu Brute</i> look.</p>

<p>‘Never you mind,’ he retorted, with incredible
courage. ‘There’s sense in what the lad says,
even though he is a bit of a hard nut. Gets
that from his father perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘His father!’ cried the mother in scorn.
‘They’re their mother’s children, both of them.
Else they’d never dare to treat me like this.’</p>

<p>There was pride as well as anger in the
glance she flashed at Edward as she gathered
up her skirts and rustled out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span></p>

<h3>PART THE THIRD<br>

<i>Sheila Fairfield</i></h3>

<h4>1</h4>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL roads led to Edward Fairfield. His
atheism, his sister, Aunt Hester’s
opposition, all conspired to fling Sheila into
the polite dispassionate arms of that rational
young graduate from Cambridge. Kay had
offered romance without intellectual comradeship:
Edward offered a kind of business
partnership in the propagation of rational
atheology, and this proved an irresistible bait
for a spirited girl hustled by disaster into
premature cynicism. Edward concerns us no
further, save that he married her, respected
her, and practised upon her the editorials that
appeared week by week in his own paper
<i>The Iconoclast</i>. Everything that he did was in
perfect taste and supported by a perfect reason.
When, for example, she declared their marriage
a failure, he provided her with a pair of admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
rooms in his own well-appointed house,
and lived thereafter in contented celibacy. He
was just to the point of inhumanity; but she,
a disappointed woman, was not just. The
efficient elegance of her home afflicted her.
It seemed a mere piece of machinery for the
daily manufacture of well-bred happiness. Her
two rooms, until she had transformed them,
seemed sleek, complacent: they announced
to her, with the patient smile and in the incisive
tones of a secularist lecturer, the supremacy
of Reason. In herself, reason was far from
supreme.</p>

<p>A woman with love must bestow it somewhere:
Sheila poured it without stint upon
her dream of Kay. Ten years divided them,
and more, before that dream was finally destroyed.
Sophie, his wife, gave birth to a child,
and Sheila, impelled by who knows what
medley of motives, visited her. They sat and
talked about nothing in a room pervaded by
yellow. A pale-brown flower perpetuated itself
at intervals on the walls; a small occasional
table set in the middle of a dark yellowish
carpet was covered by a buff cloth; a gilt-framed
oval mirror surmounted the mantelpiece.
There were photographs on the mantelpiece
of Sophie’s father, of Sophie’s child, of
Sophie, and one of Kay standing stiffly with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
book in his hand—a cruel photograph, courageously
signed by the photographer. Sheila gave
no second glance to it.</p>

<p>She interrupted a remark of Sophie’s about
the chapel Dorcas Society by saying, ‘Oh I
forgot to ask—you don’t mind Bernard being
here, do you?’</p>

<p>‘Bernard?’ Sophie was mystified.</p>

<p>Sheila pointed to the Irish terrier that was
frisking round her.</p>

<p>A little ripple of merriment came from
Sophie.</p>

<p>‘Do you call the dog Bernard? How
funny! I love dogs, but father doesn’t care
for them.... But of course he won’t mind
yours,’ she added hastily.</p>

<p>Sheila tried to puzzle out how Mr. Dewick
could even have a chance of objecting to her
dog, but just then a diversion was created by
the entry of a rather plump old-young man in a
morning coat rubbing his hands together and
making an indeterminate noise in a vague
endeavour to be hospitable. He wore a little
brown moustache and short side-whiskers near
the ears. His hair had receded considerably,
more especially where the parting
was, and had left an expanse of shining
brow.</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ he said, nervously cheerful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
‘How are you after all this while? I’m sure
we’re very pleased.’</p>

<p>Sheila recognized him instantly, although
there seemed indeed nothing of the old Kay
left to recognize. Yet this was Kay. This
was he who years ago under the moon had whispered
to her, with eyes full of dreams, his
boyish love. Shades of the meeting-house
had closed on that boy for ever.</p>

<p>Almost sick with disappointment, she shook
hands with him, and quickly sought refuge
in responding to the terrier’s still frantic
demonstrations.</p>

<p>‘I hope you like my dog,’ she remarked
to Kay, shy of using his name.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, fine fellow,’ responded Kay.
‘Come on, good dog, good dog!’</p>

<p>He patted the dog awkwardly.</p>

<p>‘We call him Bernard,’ explained Sheila,
afraid of the smallest hiatus. ‘George Bernard,
because he’s Irish and vivacious.’</p>

<p>Kay looked puzzled. ‘But why ... do
you call him George Bernard? I didn’t quite
catch....’</p>

<p>‘After Shaw, you know,’ Sheila explained.
‘We suspect Bernard of having been a distinguished
playwright in a previous incarnation.’</p>

<p>‘Oh I see!’ said Kay, his brow clearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>But it was knitted again the next moment.</p>

<p>‘What was it the Reverend Aitken was
saying about Shaw last Sunday, mother?’</p>

<p>‘I remember something,’ Sophie answered.
‘I think he said he was a mountaineer, didn’t
he?’</p>

<p>‘Mountaineer,’ murmured Kay. ‘I think
not. Ah no, mountebank! That was the
word.’</p>

<p>Here Sheila joined the conversation in a
mildly argumentative vein, but Kay sidetracked
by waxing indignant over the attempted
introduction of a liturgy into divine service.
He had set his face against <i>that</i>, he assured
them: every true nonconformist at the church
meeting had set his face against <i>that</i>, and right
feeling had ultimately triumphed over the
incipient popery. It appeared indeed that the
cosmos was being conducted in an entirely
proper manner, except for the wanton behaviour
of the east wind. He considered the east wind
very dangerous. He became impressive and
told a long story about a man of his acquaintance
who ventured out in an east wind without
his overcoat, caught a chill, developed pneumonia,
and had to take to his bed.</p>

<p>‘Dead in a week!’ finished Kay, dramatically
and with relish.</p>

<p>Except for an appreciative murmur from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
his wife, the story was received in silence.
Sheila with a stunned sensation was telling
herself: ‘I would never have let him get like
this.’ But Kay, misinterpreting the silence,
began another story. It concerned another
man who ventured out in an east wind without
his overcoat. This man had a similar series of
adventures, his experience differing from the
first man’s only in that he lingered for two
days and then died, leaving a widow and five
children. Kay could not remember whether
there were three boys and two girls, or three
girls and two boys. He began naming them
on his fingers. There were Horace and
George, Margaret and Vera. That made
four. He was sure there was another one—he
remembered the child perfectly as a baby,
but he could not for the life of him recall its
sex. He felt sure that its name began with
F.</p>

<p>He became perplexed.</p>

<p>‘Mother, can’t <i>you</i> remember?’ he asked.
The question was an accusation.</p>

<p>‘Remember what, dear?’ inquired Sophie
in her gentle way.</p>

<p>‘The name of Tomlinson’s youngest. You
remember Tomlinson.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe I do,’ said Sophie.</p>

<p>Sheila sat silent, limp under the burden of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
her disillusionment. She felt something like
fear when Sophie, with a rapturous cry, ‘She’s
awake!’, rose and darted from the room to
fetch her little girl. To hide her nervousness
she said, ‘Such an unusual name you gave
her, didn’t you? What made you think of
Robina?’</p>

<p>While Kay was losing himself in explanations
Sophie came back, leading her baby
daughter by the hand. The mother’s face was
shining.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ A passionate cry broke from Sheila.
In a moment she was on her knees gazing
with adoration at the flaxen-haired, elf-like
child. For from the big dreaming eyes her
vanished Kay looked at her; the wonderful
boy dead and buried in a prematurely old
man, lived again in this two-year old girl.
Hungrily Sheila kissed the tiny face ... and
once again she felt his arm about her and heard
his boyish whispers.</p>

<p>‘Oh, give her to me!’ she cried, looking
up over the child’s head at its father.</p>

<p>Kay’s face lit up.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got it now. I remember,’ he said
triumphantly.</p>

<p>‘What?’ asked Sophie, troubled by Sheila’s
emotion, and yet gratified by it.</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said Kay, ‘the name of Tomlinson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
youngest. It was Freddie. I told you it
began with an F.’</p>

<p>He looked round with modest pride, and
was surprised to see Sheila burst into tears.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So that was the solution of the problem.
The beauty of life was only for the young,
the very young. In a child’s heart and
nowhere else the kingdom of heaven was to
be found, a frail gossamer thing vanishing
with the years. This was the common lot:
by contact with the world to rub the down of
paradise off our souls, to grow drab and dull in
spirit, drab and dull in mind, even before that
waning of physical strength which alone could
assuage the bitterness of the process. In
Kay youth had died; in Edward—Edward
had never been young; but in herself youth
lived and craved more life. Yes, it lived
still, but now it was stricken and dying.</p>

<p>It flashed upon her then that she too could
renew her youth. In a child she could live
again.</p>

<p>But a child had been denied her.</p>

<p>She deemed her life to be already virtually
finished. She would age from this moment:
after a brief fever her mind would dim and
even the desire for beauty would sink into
oblivion. She tried to hope it would be soon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
but the struggling youth in her cried out against
the hope.</p>

<h4>2</h4>

<p>The struggling youth in her cried out, and,
years later, the cry was answered. Beauty
became incarnated in the person of Stephen
Redshawe, whose son she later encountered in
the house at Maadi. The past rose in sad
loveliness, enveloping her with the fragrance
of pressed flowers; but of all the memories
that surged in her, this one alone broke in
pitiless splendour over her consciousness.
In that moment Stephen Redshawe lived again,
less as a man and a lover than as a gleam, an
ecstasy, a chord of divine music, a symbol of
all that she had longed for and lost. Other
things she could recall minutely, but Stephen
remained a vague splendour. She recalled
how, in her little cottage near Mundesley, she
had waited for his promised coming; how
she had looked again and again, in wonder, to
find in her mirror the face he had called lovely.
It was a face ravaged less by her thirty-three
years than by discontent. His sisters and his
mother she remembered only as so many
bundles of feminine hostility. They disapproved
of her, and no wonder: was she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
not a married woman, holiday-making alone,
who yet suffered gladly the admiration of an
infatuated boy? They called her adventuress,
no doubt, and she, even in the midst of the
adventure, made allowances for them. She
had neither the strength nor the will to renounce
the fairest gift that life offered.</p>

<p>‘May I come in?’ Stephen’s tall figure filled
the doorway.</p>

<p>‘You must,’ Sheila answered, with a smile.
‘I’m not going to give you any tea while
you stand there keeping the sunshine out.’</p>

<p>‘This is our last meeting,’ blundered
Stephen. ‘I want to tell you....’</p>

<p>Suddenly dreading to hear the words for
which she longed, Sheila fended them away.
‘Eat your pretty cake,’ she admonished him.</p>

<p>After tea they went out into the sandy
paddock and talked for an hour of indifferent
things, of trains, of luggage, of books and
bad music ... until a stillness fell, heralding
dusk. Evening became personal and urgent
to enfold them: they could hear in the wash
of the water, rhythmically plashing the sand,
the rise and fall of her bosom; they could feel
her breath sweeter than apples in the autumn
air. And all the skies that during the past
weeks of stolen companionship they had seen
together, all the tides they had watched moving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
upon the shore, became fused with that sky,
with that tide; all the hours of their comradeship
were gathered up into that hour. They
surrendered themselves to the embracing arms
of silence.</p>

<p>To Sheila it was as if infinity had been
spilled into time: the moments throbbed
by, brimming with beauty, until the silence
that these two guarded became a music, a
poem, a flower of loveliness. It was a flower
that budded and blossomed till their vision
dimmed with the glory of it, a flower that
burst and fell scattering pollen and perfume.</p>

<p>He bent towards her, with cheeks flaming.
‘You know, don’t you?’ he said, and for a
moment could not go on. To Sheila life was
become exquisitely unreal, a work of art. ‘You
must know,’ he said brokenly, ‘that I adore
you.’</p>

<p>Compassionately she laid her cool hand on
his.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she said, in a low tone tenderly
soothing.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ His breath fluttered. She gave
him her trembling lips.</p>

<p>They kissed, first, like boy and girl, timidly;
then like comrades united after a long parting;
again, and a red splendour flamed through
the throbbing world. He lifted her into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
arms, and divine madness seized her. He
carried her with strong unfaltering stride into
the house.</p>

<p>And this day, which they had called the end,
was really the beginning. She returned on
the morrow to Edward’s house and confided
to her husband that she wished him to divorce
her. Edward listened patiently, like the disinterested
friend he was; but his disinterestedness
made her pride wince, and the old hated
surroundings were bleak about her. Yet on
that night of her return, in the sanctuary of
her bedroom, she undressed with a new joy.
She stood nude before the wardrobe mirror
and gazed with awe upon the pure rounded
loveliness of her own form. She stroked
gently her white velvet skin. Her body, so
long disdained, had become sacred to her
again. As she laid her head, that kingdom
of heaven, upon her pillow, and murmured
Stephen’s name, Stephen himself, in a suburb
fourteen miles away, posted his weekly letter
to the girl—no adventuress, she—who was to
become his wife and the mother of his only
son. For Stephen, too, was back in the old
routine, enfolded and pressed close to the
bosom of his family, conscious of his mother’s
eyes watching him with an angry solicitude.
Not without a struggle did he succumb. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Grace, whose pretty simplicity no longer held
him, he hinted dire things; but at the first
gesture of suffering from her he winced, and
surrendered. And he wrote to Sheila in his
best literary style. She carried the letter, as
she had carried its predecessors, into the
summer-house, that she might commune with
her lover undisturbed.</p>

<p>‘Darling,’ she read, ‘the thought of how I
must hurt you is hell to me.’</p>

<p>She caught her breath, looked once upon
the sky, and then bent her eyes again to receive
the blow....</p>

<p>With mind benumbed she looked up from
the fastidious caligraphy to find Stephen
himself standing, like a whipped dog, before
her. For a moment they strangely stared.</p>

<p>‘Why have you come?’</p>

<p>He broke out into self-pity. ‘Oh, I can’t
bear it. Don’t for God’s sake look like that....
I couldn’t leave you without a word from
your lips.’</p>

<p>She tried to harden her heart. ‘Is that
all?’</p>

<p>His hands made a helpless gesture. ‘I’m
such a despicable coward. I’ve lived always
among dreams. Real life is too hard for me—I’d
be better dead.’</p>

<p>‘Why have you come?’ she asked. ‘Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
you anything to add to this?’ She held
out his letter. ‘Why not leave it at
that?’</p>

<p>‘I had to see you,’ he said. ‘I had to ask
your forgiveness. I hoped to get here before
that thing. Oh, how detestable I am!’</p>

<p>He dropped on to the seat beside her and
sat, hunched and shaking, a figure of desolation.</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Sheila firmly. ‘Don’t
cry over spilt milk. You’re quite free now
to go back to her. And you’ve done me no
harm.’</p>

<p>He stammered in amazement. ‘You can
say that! Don’t you see how contemptible
I am! I would like to kill myself!’</p>

<p>He brooded on that thought. Death was
the only escape from his own insufferable
egoism. Then he began to perceive that he
was extracting enjoyment even from the savour
of his own self-loathing. He was rolling the
bitterness round on his tongue till it had a
certain sweetness for him. He was indulging
in an orgy of painful emotions that was delicious
to the very egoism it wounded. He was
discovering hitherto unplumbed depths in his
nature and being fascinated by the stupendous
spectacle of his own soul’s suffering. And
he knew that the experience was far too
morbidly interesting to drive him to suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>The perception of his self-pity afflicted
Sheila with a new and more sickening pain.
Something of this change must have been
visible in her face, for with a manifest effort
he became calm, and began speaking in more
normal tones.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps we shall be glad afterwards,’ he
said slowly. ‘The scandal would have killed
my mother....’</p>

<p>Sheila winced. ‘Oh, Stephen, are you
trying to make me hate you? Why did you
say that?...’</p>

<p>‘Why——’</p>

<p>‘Why do you talk in that unreal way?
Why do you pretend ... try at the last
moment to blind me with false pious reasoning!’</p>

<p>‘But what I said about my mother——’</p>

<p>‘—Was false as water. You didn’t mean
a word of it. You are too dreadfully sorry for
yourself to care about your mother. You’re
breaking faith, and because it hurts you you’re
trying to feel good about it. God knows I
haven’t disputed your decision—nor even
blamed you for it. But now, please go!’</p>

<p>He rose. ‘I am not to come back?’</p>

<p>‘No, no. Go away.’</p>

<p>‘But, Sheila——’</p>

<p>‘Why will you torture me so?’ she cried.
‘It’s your own choice. If only you’d never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
come to-night—it would have been so much
kinder.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I can’t bear this!’ He trembled
towards her.</p>

<p>She rose, to confront him with lustreless eyes.</p>

<p>‘Are you made of straw? Can you neither
take me nor leave me?... Good-bye.’</p>

<p>‘God, how you hate me now!’ he murmured,
as she swept past him.</p>

<p>She paused to say: ‘That should be nothing
to you. But it’s not true. You have done
me no harm. I had never known happiness
before you came ... but,’ she added, with
his child in her womb, ‘I shall soon forget,
and you will have made no difference. None
at all.’</p>

<p>She stumbled out into the hateful sunlight
and went, half-running, towards the house.</p>

<h4>3</h4>

<p>In Edward’s house, and with Edward’s
bored approval—for he was busy at the time
on a scathing history of the Jesuits—Stephen’s
child was born. And, in the triumph that
followed agony, the spirit of Sheila rose from
the dead. Four years later, determined to
purge herself of bitterness, she visited the
scene of her love. When she entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
paddock again, her silent but excited child at
her side, her eyes filled with tears at the sight
of the old romantic disorder that had once
so charmed her. ‘These poppies,’ her heart
said, ‘are children of flowers that witnessed
our love.’ The paddock was shut in on three
sides by a hedge of briar. In the long rank
grass numberless weeds had rioted unchecked
for many years, and the hand of the picnicker
lay heavy on the land. A medley of docks,
nettles, thistles, poppies, empty cigarette packets,
paper bags, ginger-beer bottles, and
corks, greeted Sheila’s eyes. ‘What a pickle!’
she said.</p>

<p>‘What a lovely pickle, Sheila,’ the little girl
echoed. She began collecting corks with the
solemnity of an elderly spinster gathering a
cautionary nosegay for a drunkard’s grave.
This was a simile that Sheila, gravely nonsensical,
suggested to Rosemary, who with
perfect dignity assented. ‘How fortunate
that Edward isn’t here to be shocked by
my vulgarity,’ Sheila thought.</p>

<p>Entering the house she found there matter
for surprise: a greasy plate, a crust of bread,
and a breakfast cup, caked with tannin, standing
ankle-deep in a saucer half-full of spilt tea. The
next moment Mrs. Boddy arrived, a little red
berry of humanity to whom had been entrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
a duplicate key and the duty of preparing the
place for habitation.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ma’am!’ said Mrs. Boddy. ‘To
think that you should have got ’ere before me,
without a bit of tea ready or nothing.’ The
sight of those inglorious festal remains was the
culminating assault on her feelings. ‘There!
Just look at that.’</p>

<p>Sheila nodded, smiling. ‘Some one’s been
here evidently. The question is, Who?’</p>

<p>‘And how?’ added Mrs. Boddy. ‘’Ow?’
she repeated, by way of emphasis. ‘And oh,’
she cried, enveloping Rosemary, ‘here’s the
dear little ducky duck. Hasn’t she got a kiss
for the wicked old woman that didn’t get her
mother’s tea ready?’</p>

<p>Having released Rosemary, Mrs. Boddy
stood brooding. ‘There’s been a man here.
One of those persons of the tramp class.’</p>

<p>After a moment’s contemplation of this
hypothetical tramp, ‘It’s not at all nice,’ she
added, and drew away from the polluted table.
‘You might be murdered in your beds.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if one must be murdered, one could
hardly choose a more comfortable place,’ said
Sheila. ‘Let’s try to make a fire to boil
the kettle on, shall we? I’m longing for my
tea.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Boddy became the embodiment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
bustle. She shot out of the house in search of
dry sticks for the fire.</p>

<p>‘And do you know what I would do if I
were you, ma’am?’ she enquired, reappearing
after a brief and successful forage. ‘I’d have
my tea and go straight back to town. Straight
back. I wouldn’t stay another minute.’</p>

<p>‘Not stay!’ echoed Sheila in weak astonishment.
‘Not stay for a holiday?’</p>

<p>‘Not to be murdered, I wouldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘After coming all this way?’</p>

<p>‘Not to be murdered,’ repeated Mrs. Boddy
firmly.</p>

<p>‘But perhaps we shan’t be murdered.’</p>

<p>‘You mark my words,’ Mrs. Boddy admonished
her.</p>

<p>Sheila laughed. ‘I’m not going to be
frightened away by a dirty cup and saucer.’</p>

<p>‘Well, let’s hope for the best,’ said Mrs.
Boddy, with an unexpected access of cheerfulness.
‘And after all, if anything nasty <i>does</i>
happen, I’m not above half a mile away, am
I?’</p>

<p>She emerged, goggle-eyed, from the
pantry.</p>

<p>‘And blest if me lord haven’t helped himself
to the stores I got in for you!’ she exclaimed,
shrilly indignant; and then, with
lingering pathos: ‘Oh, <i>ma’am</i>!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>After tea Mrs. Boddy went home, and
Sheila took her child into the belittered paddock,
and sat in a deck-chair, crocheting, and watching
the shadows lengthen, while Rosemary in
her busily silent fashion wandered in the
long grasses. From time to time the little
girl took an occasional bite out of an apple
with which Mrs. Boddy had sought to win
her regard, until she made a discovery that
sent her running to her mother, somewhat
sternly demanding why she had been given
an apple from which the cork had not been
removed. Later, the paddock was invaded
by a sleek brown dog with melancholy eyes,
velvet ears, and a general air of unctuous
virtue, with whom Rosemary instantly made
friends.</p>

<p>‘What a dear dog,’ she said, returning to
Sheila’s chair after spending twenty minutes
in the company of this engaging creature.</p>

<p>‘Yes. He seems at home here,’ replied
Sheila, thinking of Mrs. Boddy’s tramp.</p>

<p>‘Of <i>course</i> he’s at home,’ said the child with
magisterial emphasis. ‘I asked him to make
himself at home. And he did.’</p>

<p>‘How friendly of him.’ Sheila’s eyes drank
in eagerly the absurd delicious gravity of
Rosemary’s thought-puckered face. ‘I wonder
what his name is.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>‘His name,’ answered the child casually,
‘is Poker.’ After a pause she added: ‘Poker
Morgan his name is. He’s just come home
from school.’ Sheila waited with becoming
seriousness for further details of Poker Morgan’s
eventful life. ‘He goes to school every
day,’ Rosemary went on. ‘Every day except
Sunday. On Sunday he doesn’t go to school,
he doesn’t. He stays at home with his
mother.’</p>

<p>‘How nice for Mrs. Morgan,’ said Sheila.
‘And what does Poker learn at school?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, just lessons; that’s all.’ Rosemary
dismissed the question with the air of having
sufficiently explained everything. ‘May I
have another sponge finger, please, Sheila?’</p>

<p>Irresponsibly light-hearted, Sheila retired to
bed, joining Rosemary in the little attic room
with the homicidal slanting roof. She stood
for some time at the east window, bathing in
the moonlight, and looking towards the sea
which broke within twenty yards of the
crumbling wall. The wind fluttered her night-dress.</p>

<p>Nocturnal calm was abruptly shattered by
a beer-thickened voice uttering a passionate
demand for admittance. Sheila stepped quickly
across the room to the western window.</p>

<p>‘You let me in before yourrurt,’ urged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
voice. And Sheila, leaning out of the window,
saw a gentleman in baggy corduroys that were
tied with string at the knees peering up at her
malevolently from under a huge cloth cap.
The moon focussed her light upon his impressive
figure.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Boddy’s tramp,’ murmured Sheila,
secure in the knowledge of having made fast
all doors and windows.</p>

<p>‘I’ll soon show you whose ’ouse it is,’
promised the gentleman in the garden.</p>

<p>‘Please go away,’ Sheila advised him.
‘I’m sure you must be ready for your bed.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Boddy’s tramp found this well-meant
counsel literally staggering. He executed a
series of curious plunges, and having described
a complete circle resumed his original stance.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s go away, is it?’</p>

<p>‘It really is,’ Sheila assured him. ‘I’m
too tired to entertain a strayed reveller. Please
go away. I’m going to shut the window.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s shut the window, is it?...’
enquired the strange gentleman, in a slightly
more conciliatory tone. ‘’Oose window?
Answer me that.’</p>

<p>But the spirit of nonsense in Sheila had
tired itself out. She withdrew into the room,
and when the voice broke loose again from
its owner’s control, she began to feel impatient.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
Presently this nuisance would waken Rosemary,
and perhaps even frighten her. This
fear sent her quickly back to the window.</p>

<p>‘If you don’t go away at once my husband
will fetch a policeman.’</p>

<p>‘I’m a Nopper by trade,’ continued the
visitor, unaccountably and savagely hurling
his cap on the ground. ‘Can’t I turn me
head a minute without a mob like you stealing
the ’ouse off me back? Answer me that.’</p>

<p>The serene little figure of Rosemary sat up
suddenly in bed.</p>

<p>‘Who’s that shouting to you, Sheila?’</p>

<p>‘The gentleman’s a hopper, dear. Go to
sleep again, like a good girl.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t like him,’ said Rosemary. ‘Tell
Mr. Hopper to go away.’</p>

<p>Sheila shut the window; and after a while
the visitor withdrew, leaving behind him a dirty
cloth cap and the germ of a new mythology.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the morning Rosemary found inscrutable
but sufficient cause to reverse her condemnation
of Mr. Hopper. She spent the odd
moments of the next day embellishing the ideal
portrait that her surprising young fancy had
drawn. At breakfast Mr. Hopper was a nice
large gentleman; by lunchtime he was wearing
blue spectacles, had developed a taste for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
sponge fingers, and was clad in a velvet jacket,
like Edward’s, with cavernous pockets containing
a clockwork train and a woolly-pated black
doll. The next day he mysteriously acquired
a brown beard and a pair of spotty trousers
similar to those of a certain harlequin prominent
among Rosemary’s cherished memories, and
before the week was out he was provided with
a Botticelli halo that added sanctity to an already
distinguished appearance. Stories of his wonderful
doings began to circulate: how he
had travelled in a train to the City to buy
feeding-bottles for Rosemary’s children; how
his several mothers (a generic term that included
wives) had had to physic his cough; and how
bravely he could ride elephants. Mr. Hopper
had various secondary designations: sometimes
he was known as the man with a lot of
mothers (a distinction he perhaps derived
from Bluebeard); sometimes, more tersely, as
‘my friend’; and sometimes as Poker Morgan’s
father. In short Mr. Hopper was
canonized; Mr. Hopper became a legend.
He went triumphantly upon his swaggering,
nonsensical, polygamous, but none the less
kindly way in Rosemary’s mind, a figure of
flaming glory and infinite adaptability; until
abruptly, and without pity, she tired of him
and turned to other joys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>On Sunday morning she was taken, for the
first time, to church; whence she returned
consumingly curious. To Sheila, who had
hoped for no more than a vague æsthetic
enjoyment, the ceremony had been disappointing.
She felt unequal to explaining why
Rosemary must on no account bestow the
big pockets and spotty trousers of her generous
imagination upon members of the Holy Trinity,
whose names the little girl had fatally remembered.
But blasphemy being so clearly
imminent, Sheila addressed herself with a
sigh to the task of averting it.</p>

<p>‘Jesus, dear, was the name of a real person,
someone who really lived. Not like Mr.
Hopper.’</p>

<p>Rosemary’s intense dark eyes grew profoundly
reproachful. This lapse from poetic
faith on the part of so skilled a fellow-artist
as Sheila was terrible. It was as though
the whole beautiful city of pretence was
threatened with hostile invasion.</p>

<p>‘But Mr. Hopper is real too,’ Rosemary
said, with quivering lip.</p>

<p>‘Of course he is,’ agreed Sheila hastily.
‘How silly of me! But he is different.
You mustn’t mix him up with these others.’</p>

<p>When some working agreement in this
delicate matter had been reached, they went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to the beach together to dig sand castles and
tell each other stories: an idyllic experience,
type of many shared during this magical
holiday.</p>

<h4>4</h4>

<p>Then upon the smooth sands of this quietude
Terror planted his ugly hoof. Rosemary was
seized with illness. Unaccountably, in spite
of Sheila’s lavish care, she had caught a
dangerous chill.</p>

<p>Sheila locked up the house, and ran, already
feverish with anxiety, to Mrs. Boddy. She
arrived breathless, to find that amiable woman
with her arms up to the elbows in soapy
water.</p>

<p>‘It’s Rosemary—she’s ill,’ gasped Sheila.
‘Please fetch someone quickly.’ She dropped
into the nearest chair, breathing hard.</p>

<p>The red hands leaped out of the wash-tub
and were rubbed on an immaculate white
apron.</p>

<p>‘Pore lamb!’ cried Mrs. Boddy. ‘What’s
wrong with her?’</p>

<p>Sheila was now upon her feet again, her
breath recovered. ‘I don’t quite know. She
caught cold yesterday. I doctored her as
best I could. But this morning she’s worse—breathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
badly and almost delirious. Please
go at once. She’s alone in the house—I’m
going back.’</p>

<p>The vision of the sick child calling in
vain for its mother stabbed Sheila to an impossible
speed. After running a few hundred
yards she was overtaken and picked up by a
man driving a trap.</p>

<p>Back in the cottage, ‘I must keep calm.
I mustn’t lose control of myself,’ she urged
upon her wildly beating heart; and she
climbed the stairs trying not to be terrified
by the deathly silence of the place. When
she opened the bedroom door she could
hear the sawing noise of the child’s breathing,
and fear laid a cold finger on her brain: could
that be what they called the death-rattle?</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ she said, half-aloud, ‘if I lose my
nerve I shall be useless to her in her greatest
need.’ And, deciding that she could do
no more, she forced herself to sit down and
await with iron patience the doctor’s coming.
She wondered whether she would do wrong
if she opened the window she had in her
first panic shut. The room was unbearably
stuffy. ‘Pure air <i>must</i> be better than bad,’
she told herself; and unfastened the catch.
The garden seemed full of sunshine and
birds and the smell of honeysuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>She turned her head at the sound of steps
on the stairs. ‘At last!’</p>

<p>A commanding and resolute female figure
appeared in the doorway: Edward’s sister,
Hypatia.</p>

<p>‘Well, Sheila,’ said Hypatia, humorously
grim. ‘You keep open house, I see.’</p>

<p>Sheila stared, unable and uncaring to hide
her disappointment. ‘Oh, you mean my
leaving the front door open. That’s for the
doctor.’</p>

<p>Hypatia stepped into the room. ‘Something’s
wrong.’ Her tone became gentle as
her glance fell upon Rosemary. ‘Rosemary—she’s
ill?’</p>

<p>‘Yes ... Rosemary.’ Sheila’s voice lingeringly
caressed the name.</p>

<p>‘Poor little kid,’ Hypatia murmured. ‘What
is it?’</p>

<p>In an undertone Sheila began repeating
her simple story. ‘Oh, I do wish the doctor
would come!’ she broke off. ‘It may be
pneumonia or something even more dreadful.’</p>

<p>Instantly forgetting Hypatia, she paced
to the door and began running downstairs.
And at that moment a trap drew up outside
the house, and the doctor entered, followed
at a respectful distance by Mrs. Boddy.
He was a tall curvilinear man with a stoop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and an air of intense preoccupation. With
a perfunctory response to Sheila’s eager greeting
he followed her upstairs. Furtively, with
eyes veiling mistrust, she watched him approach
the bedside.</p>

<p>Twenty seconds later her feelings towards
him had totally changed. He won her heart
by the smile that flickered for a moment in
his face at first sight of his patient, and by
the gentleness with which he unclasped Rosemary’s
fingers from the woolly bear that her
arm embraced. Sheila gave herself to the
answering of his professional questions.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Her fears a little stilled by the doctor’s
reassurances, she surrendered to Hypatia’s
importunity by withdrawing with her into
the garden for a few moments.</p>

<p>‘Now, Sheila, my dear,’ Hypatia urged,
taking her arm with a sisterly caressing,
‘you’re not to worry. Worry’s fatal. The
kid’s going to get well quite soon.’</p>

<p>‘Do you really think so?’ asked Sheila,
pathetically eager.</p>

<p>Hypatia feigned exasperated wonder. ‘Well,
I’m dashed!’ she exclaimed, in the old school-girl
tone of nearly forty years ago. ‘What’s
the good of calling in a doctor and paying
him ridiculous fees if you don’t believe what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
he tells you? Didn’t Mr. New Moon say
she’d be out of bed in a fortnight?’</p>

<p>‘With care,’ supplemented Sheila, on whose
brain the doctor’s words were indelibly written.</p>

<p>‘Of course, with care. Without care we
should all come to grief.’</p>

<p>Sheila faintly smiled. ‘Do you remember
when you so hotly denied the reality of sin,
sickness, and death?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that’s long ago,’ said Hypatia good-humouredly.
‘I’ve had a varied career since
then. Still, we live and learn.’</p>

<p>‘What’s the latest?’ asked Sheila.</p>

<p>‘The latest?’</p>

<p>‘The latest religious nostrum.’</p>

<p>‘Back in the fold for a time.’ Hypatia
seemed to enjoy the new-found pleasure of
poking fun at herself. ‘Do you remember
Herbert Spencer, Sheila? But one can’t
rest there. For me it’s Woman Suffrage
now. It’s got to come. And I’m reading
Butler again. Good stuff. <i>Life and Habit</i>
especially, and <i>Unconscious Memory</i>. Jumps
on Darwin for having banished mind from
the universe. But you haven’t asked me why
I’ve come yet. Aren’t you surprised to see me?’</p>

<p>‘Why have you come?’ Sheila asked
obediently. ‘I’m very glad you did come,’
she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>‘I wonder if you are really,’ mused Hypatia.
‘We’ve been too polite to each other since
we were married, Sheila, too polite to be quite
good friends. Never mind. I came to say
good-bye. Bunny’s got a job in Cairo. Something
to do with irrigation. The sort of thing
he wanted.’</p>

<p>‘Must I congratulate you?’ said Sheila.
‘No, I won’t. You two are going to Egypt,
and I shall never see you again. How very
unpleasant of you.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you could come too. But Edward
couldn’t very well move his little pet idol
<i>The Iconoclast</i> to Cairo.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that wouldn’t matter to me.’ Sheila
was too weary to maintain a pretence.</p>

<p>Hypatia raised her eyebrows. ‘You’ve
quarrelled?’</p>

<p>‘My dear Hypatia, can you imagine Edward
being so unreasonable as to quarrel? We
could part without tears, I assure you. But
that doesn’t mean I can come to Cairo with
you. There’s Rosemary to consider.’</p>

<p>Hypatia smiled grimly. ‘That’s very thin.
Go and pack your trunk for Egypt, Sheila.’</p>

<p>Conversation was cut short by the arrival
of the doctor.</p>

<p>‘She is already a little more comfortable,’
he assured Sheila, ‘and sleeping.’ A fugitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
smile crossed his face. ‘She is talking in her
sleep about fire-irons, so far as I can make out.
A certain poker....’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s Poker Morgan,’ interposed
Sheila, happy at the sound of so friendly a
name. ‘When will you come again?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Boddy is with the patient. An
admirable person. I shall call again to-night.
Now, Mrs. Fairfield, are you a sensible
woman?’</p>

<p>Sheila, eagerly submissive, hoped that she
was. ‘I’ll do anything for her that you tell
me. She’s all I’ve got.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you will,’ he said. ‘But if you’re
a sensible woman you’ll not be alarmed when
I suggest taking a second professional opinion.’</p>

<p>‘Please do,’ begged Sheila, who had long
made a secret determination to insist on such a
precaution.</p>

<p>‘It’s not that I’m afraid about the child.
But I’m a cautious man. And I’ve never
held omniscience to be part of a physician’s
equipment. She has had these chills
before?’</p>

<p>‘Frequently, but never so badly.’</p>

<p>‘The nose and throat are affected,’ said
the curving doctor. ‘She’s acutely susceptible
to cold. Treacherous east winds about. Bad
place, England, for a constitution like hers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
You should take her to a warm climate: warm
and dry.’</p>

<p>With a boyish air of having finished a
necessary recital he raised his hat and began
picking his way across the wilderness of
paddock.</p>

<p>Sheila glanced at her friend’s face. Triumph
danced in the eyes of Hypatia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span></p>

<h3>PART THE FOURTH<br>

<i>Evening of the Same Day</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">‘SLIP away while you can, and have a look
at my Thought Forms,’ Mr. Bunnard
had urged the agitated young man; and by
politely acquiescing Stephen Redshawe’s son
had condemned himself to suffer a two hours’
mystical monologue illustrated by coloured
drawings. When they at last emerged from
what the old gentleman termed, with accidental
aptness, his den, the Egyptian dark had come,
not at one stride yet swiftly, to envelop the
house at Maadi.</p>

<p>But the darkness of this particular April
evening was but a more exquisite light: day
seen through a veil of mystery, purged of its
glare. Moon shed her unearthly pallor over
the piazza with its pattern in ochre and green,
and silvered the leaves of the lebbek trees in
the garden. The intense dark blue of the sky
was numerously divided by the fine mesh of
the mosquito netting that clung to the supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
white columns. When Rosemary left
the piano and sat down in the deck-chair
opposite Redshawe, only the incessant dry
rattle of crickets remained to make the stillness
musical. She came like cool rain; she seemed
to bring with her a dewy grace that dispelled
the languor wrought in him by the too-intoxicating
syringa; and he reposed gratefully in
the unmeasured comfort of her nearness.</p>

<p>Redshawe, dilettante in letters, groped in his
mind for a phrase that should symbolize the
baffling quality in her: a quality as indefinable
as the fragrance of musk-roses. ‘Incarnate
stillness’ hovered for his choosing; but the
futility of his efforts becoming thereby so
patent, he abandoned the search, quite reverently
sighing. Stillness, silence, the very
spirit of quietude, in her became personal.
She had light brown hair and olive skin; she
was perhaps twenty-five years old; but her
unfathomable dark eyes gazed from an oval
face absurdly angelic with the sublime gravity
of a child. With Mrs. Bunnard rasping on
one side of him and Mr. Bunnard chirping a
high-pitched chorus part on the other, Redshawe
strained his ears to catch Rosemary’s
soft tones. In conversation she palpitated an
innocent curiosity. She focussed those twin
orbs of mystery upon his religious doubts;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
and not all the mature intelligence of her arguments
could obscure for him the shining of her
angel-infancy. That very phrase flashed on
him while they talked, an echo from his reading,
suggesting another, from the same source,
that for a while almost satisfied his longing
for an adequate symbol. ‘A white celestial
thought.’ Yes: Rosemary herself was a white
celestial thought.</p>

<p>‘The fundamental cause of reincarnation,’
said Mrs. Bunnard firmly, ‘is, as you know,
the lust for sentient life. Once we have conquered
that——’</p>

<p>‘We shall have reached a consummation,’
interpolated her husband, ‘much, as Shakespeare
says, to be desired.’</p>

<p>‘The law of periodicity, Mr. Redshawe,’
Mrs. Bunnard assured him, ‘is perfectly obvious
and understandable. Night and day, life and
death, sleeping and waking—all these simple
alternations are but manifestations of a universal
rhythm.’</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, ‘The systole and diastole,’
cried Mr. Bunnard, deftly inserting a
smile and a phrase into the manifest gap, ‘the
systole and diastole of the Cosmic Heart.’</p>

<p>Desperately, like a goaded animal, ‘But
what,’ asked Redshawe, ‘has all this God-throb....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>A surprising ripple of laughter arrested his
question and drew his eyes back to Rosemary.
Sheila came generously to the rescue and distracted
to herself the enemy’s fire. In a little
while Mrs. Bunnard withdrew to her bedroom
with the announced intention of meditating;
and the battle raged less furiously between the
two remaining elders: so healingly less that
Redshawe had a beatific sense of being alone
in the universe with his divinity.</p>

<p>He plunged deeply into the cool waters of
her elusive beauty, and they talked eagerly,
yet with harmonious pauses ... until he
chanced to see that on the third finger of her
left hand she wore a plain gold ring.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Too desperately stricken to pay another
moment’s homage to his ideal English reticence,
he in effect ran like a hurt child to Rosemary’s
mother by contriving an early opportunity of
solitary speech with her. He the more readily
exposed his wound to Sheila because he now
perceived what until the shattering to bits of
his fool’s paradise had been beyond his vision:
that Sheila too was suffering.</p>

<p>‘She’s married!’ he protested to her.</p>

<p>‘Rosemary?’ she wearily answered
him.</p>

<p>‘Rosemary, of course,’ he cried, forgetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
both patience and ceremony. ‘You didn’t tell
me.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t tell you?’ Sheila repeated in
astonishment.</p>

<p>Flushed and gloomy, he made equine plunges
towards the explanation he considered so
superfluous.</p>

<p>‘Well, didn’t you know? Of course, you
must have known. Yet how should you?’</p>

<p>‘Know!’ echoed Sheila. ‘Know that she
was married?’</p>

<p>‘No, no.’ Impatiently he shook the suggestion
away. ‘What it means to me—you must
have known that?’</p>

<p>‘My poor boy! What <i>does</i> it mean to
you?’</p>

<p>They stared at each other with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>‘Everything,’ answered his helpless gesture.</p>

<p>Her face contracted with pain. She bowed
her head. With pain, swiftly, she bowed her
head. For one terrible moment he thought
she was going to weep.</p>

<p>He put his arm round her shoulders.</p>

<p>‘It must be much worse for you,’ he said
vaguely, wishing to help. Already he knew
dimly that he, being young, would forget some
day.</p>

<p>She moved gently away from him. ‘But
we mustn’t be tragic, must we?’ she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
trying to smile. ‘You don’t quite understand.’</p>

<p>‘I understand something,’ he pleaded, lest
his sympathy should be repulsed. ‘So very
little, but something. I’ve loved her for
weeks ... but she must be infinitely more
to you.’</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t thinking of Rosemary,’ said Sheila.
‘Please don’t look quite like that,’ she almost
passionately added.</p>

<p>He trod the fringe of the incomprehensible.
‘Ah, you were thinking.... My way of
speaking perhaps reminded you....’</p>

<p>‘I was thinking of Rosemary’s father,’ Sheila
abruptly assured him. ‘And so you are in
love with my daughter, are you?’ She spoke
almost coldly. ‘Would you think me very
bitter if I congratulated you on losing her?’</p>

<p>His face was all question.</p>

<p>‘She would have broken your heart. She
is very hard to those that love her.’</p>

<p>‘Hard!’ His tone was almost scornful in
its incredulity. ‘With the face of an angel
and the wondering eyes of a child!’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Have you never seen a child pick
wings off flies? Rosemary is still a child.
Enchanting. Sweet beyond words. But with
a child’s incapacity for love.’</p>

<p>‘But she’s <i>married</i>!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>‘Yes,’ Sheila answered, with dreadful serenity.
‘She was married this afternoon, when I supposed
her to be at the Lodge with her aunt.
She dropped in somewhere to be married, and
picked up Hypatia on the way home.’</p>

<p>‘But....’ Redshawe was helpless.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I knew it must come soon. She had
been engaged for some years.’</p>

<p>‘May I ask to whom?’</p>

<p>‘The Reverend Oliver Wendell Brunt, an
American gentleman.’</p>

<p>Redshawe paced the room. ‘And where
in thunder is he?’</p>

<p>‘On his knees, no doubt, invoking God’s
blessing on his work in China. He is a
missionary. They leave to-morrow together.
They’ve just had the call from God and must
obey at once. Rosemary has apologized very
nicely for her eccentricity. She was afraid I
might make a fuss, and cry at the ceremony;
so she arranged it this way. And she just
doesn’t understand what it all means to me.’</p>

<p>‘What an inhuman crowd they are!’ muttered
Redshawe. And he gasped to recall
Rosemary’s serene bearing, her untroubled
beauty, her lucid reasoning, her faultless rendering
of Scriabine, and the placid prattle of her
uncle and aunt. An incredible household.</p>

<p>Silence fell between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>‘Forgive me, Mrs. Fairfield,’ broke out
Redshawe after a while. ‘I shouldn’t have
blundered in with my self-pity. But mine isn’t
a boyish fancy or any rot of that kind. To me
she is just pure beauty. I’ve always worshipped
beauty. I could have poured out my
life like wine at her feet.’</p>

<p>‘And to me,’ said Sheila, ‘she was a little
helpless thing that fumbled at my breasts.
She’s been my whole life for twenty-six years.
I waited for her coming as for the coming of
God.... Let’s go in: they’ll be waiting
supper for us!’</p>

<p>Sadly, ‘Life seems to promise so much,’
Redshawe began, with the unique solemnity
of adolescence. ‘Beauty stands in the doorway
and beckons ... and when we follow
she’s vanished.’</p>

<p>‘Lucky boy!’ with a wan smile Sheila said
to him. ‘You’ll be busy writing lyrics about
this to-morrow.’</p>

<p>The door opened noiselessly, and in the
doorway, two slender white fingers resting on
the handle, stood Rosemary, lightly poised on
her toes as though for celestial flight. Her
eyes sparkled with an almost stellar radiance;
her cheeks were delicately flushed, and her lips
a little parted, like the petals of an awakening
rosebud. Redshawe, abashed at the memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
of having criticized her for inhumanity, worshipped
once more her divinity, lapsed into
mute adoration; and Sheila held her breath,
telling herself: ‘I may never see her stand
like that again.’</p>

<p>‘Supper’s ready, mother. I’m sure you’re
both hungry.’ The words did but tremble in
the air for a moment, and then became no
more than an imperishable memory for mother
and lover.</p>

<p>‘Do let me take you in, Mrs. Fairfield,’
said Redshawe, affectionately, compassionately
gallant; and as Sheila, a little tremulous but
gravely mistress of herself, took the arm he
offered, ‘Thank you, my dear,’ she rewarded
him. But in her heart she was saying: ‘The
last supper.’</p>
